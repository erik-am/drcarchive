<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to the D&#8217;ni Restoration Archive. Our goal is to archive as much material as possible from the two attempts to restore the D&#8217;ni cavern to its former glory. At this website you can find KI mails that were once sent to explorers, interviews, all kinds of documents, updates on the restoration posted by DRC members, etcetera, etcetera.</p>

<p>This archive is unique in that it is just an archive, nothing more, nothing less. Our intend is to present the archived material as raw as possible, without any modifications. So if you like digging through old, dusty material, this is the place to be. If you just want to know more about a certain topic without having to look too far, I would recommend the comprehensive <a href="http://www.dpwr.net/forums/index.php?autocom=ibwiki">D&#8217;niPedia</a> at <a href="http://www.dpwr.net">DPWR.net</a> instead.</p>
