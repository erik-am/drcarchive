#### History

Started by Guild Master Kadish (Guild of Writers), the store was opened after his dismissal from the Guild of Writers. The store carried a number of outsider art pieces.

#### Synopsis

The Kadish store is a mix-match of artifacts collected from both Dâ€™ni artisans as well as outsider artisans before the Fall. Though the store has been in dis-repair for hundreds of years the DRC cleaned it up a bit before opening it. As a result, most of its artifacts are clearly visible and presentable for perusing.
