#### History

Eder Gira was written during the “Garden Binge” of the 8100's along with Eder Kemo and numerous others.

#### Synopsis

Though the Age was given to the D'ni general population by the Lords of the time, Gira was quickly discovered to house a number of animals, a native population, and archeological records of varying kinds. The Age was removed from general access and given to various study groups.

The actual Age of Eder Gira is much larger than the portion that will be released to the public initially.

Outlying areas are diverse and surprsingly different than those already open. Much work is needed.
