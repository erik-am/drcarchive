**Garden KI Snapshot 2002-06-01 k**

Best of Garden KI shapshots. Taken with KI C7. Image uploaded after return. C-class KIs don't have the chromatic aberration evident in the B-class KIs, so the correction software has actually caused the aberration. Other issues: Periphery blurring and vignetting. (No lattice artifacts.)
