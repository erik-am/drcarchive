(11/19 15:35:22) Aladrin Kelahn: You're standing by Douglas Sharper, in case you didn't notice, Dusante.
(11/19 15:35:35) Dusante: cool
(11/19 15:35:41) Gregor: but teledahn is a lot bigger than the things we saw in Uru prime?
(11/19 15:36:07) Christoph05: So, Douglas should we be getting ready for a visit from Mr. Engberg again tonight?
(11/19 15:36:11) From Merlin: hi all
(11/19 15:36:18) Douglas Sharper: NOt sure what Prime is but Teledahn is big.
(11/19 15:36:30) Gregor: I mean Uru offline
(11/19 15:36:31) Merlin: Hi all
(11/19 15:36:46) Douglas Sharper: Yeah, not following you there. Offline?
(11/19 15:37:04) Dusante: (In character guys)
(11/19 15:37:20) Douglas Sharper: In character?
(11/19 15:37:26) Gregor: The part of Teledahn that came with the boxed game
(11/19 15:37:35) Christoph05: Just part of a conversation we were having earlier Douglas
(11/19 15:37:36) Dusante: When will the DRC open more of Teledahn?
(11/19 15:37:50) Douglas Sharper: Whenever they get off their duff and start working.
(11/19 15:37:57) Jemedet: Riven is better.
(11/19 15:38:00) Aladrin Kelahn: Ha! Good answer!
(11/19 15:38:00) Dusante: hehe
(11/19 15:38:01) Gregor: I mean the map in your office shows there is a lot more to discover
(11/19 15:38:13) Douglas Sharper: More than you can imagine.
(11/19 15:38:20) Aladrin Kelahn laughs
(11/19 15:38:34) Christoph05: What is your opinion of Mr Engberg, Douglas? Off the record
(11/19 15:38:38) Dusante: How close have you gotten to Shroomie? I've been watching her for a while
(11/19 15:38:54) Douglas Sharper: Close enough.
(11/19 15:39:00) Gregor: did you have a boat to discover teledahn?
(11/19 15:39:23) Douglas Sharper: Of sorts. Yes.
(11/19 15:40:01) Gregor: What can I do with these "spore" machines?
(11/19 15:40:31) Douglas Sharper: Play with them.
(11/19 15:40:35) Aladrin Kelahn: Later all
(11/19 15:40:35) Aladrin Kelahn waves
(11/19 15:40:44) Christoph05: What will happen when we play with them?
(11/19 15:40:58) Garvin: later AK
(11/19 15:41:04) Douglas Sharper: Any of you met the DRC boys?
(11/19 15:41:08) Gregor: I wanted the birds to come closer, but they're not interested in the spores maybe
(11/19 15:41:09) nytram: yes
(11/19 15:41:16) nytram: they were here this time yesterday
(11/19 15:41:24) Christoph05: I met Engberg last night... after i stumbled upon a nexus book
(11/19 15:41:26) Douglas Sharper: And how were they?
(11/19 15:41:36) nytram: a bit concerned!
(11/19 15:41:44) nytram: bit officious
(11/19 15:41:57) Gregor: Rand didn't talk a lot
(11/19 15:42:00) Christoph05: You tell us your opinions!
(11/19 15:42:01) nytram: specially Dr Kodama
(11/19 15:42:08) Douglas Sharper: Yes, that's them. Concerned and official.
(11/19 15:42:17) Douglas Sharper: Kodama! Ha!
(11/19 15:42:24) nytram: anyone would think they own this place!
(11/19 15:42:40) Douglas Sharper: Well they think they do.
(11/19 15:42:51) Douglas Sharper: If you only knew what they've done to me.
(11/19 15:42:59) nytram: we can see lol
(11/19 15:43:02) BobbyK: did Engberg catch you by the ferry landing Chris?
(11/19 15:43:03) Christoph05: Do tell Douglas
(11/19 15:43:38) Christoph05: Actually many of us were standing outsde the pub. He warned us of being careful. we didn't leave though
(11/19 15:43:57) Douglas Sharper: Good for you.
(11/19 15:44:08) Douglas Sharper: Don't pay attention to their stupid rules.
(11/19 15:44:12) Christoph05: Do you have any linking books you can share?
(11/19 15:44:23) From Kosh in DRC (1) Neighborhood: bah, I tend to ignore the DRC, usually. :)
(11/19 15:44:30) Douglas Sharper: Sorry. Not yet.
(11/19 15:44:58) Christoph05: Not even an Un-certified DRC book you have?
(11/19 15:45:08) Gregor: What is Noloben like, Douglas?
(11/19 15:45:23) Douglas Sharper: I didn't say I didn't have any books.
(11/19 15:45:25) launton: i hear we have only seen 1/4 of teledahn douglas, is that correct?
(11/19 15:45:30) BobbyK: I think I'm missing chat text... is anyone else noticing this?
(11/19 15:45:34) Douglas Sharper: I suppose.
(11/19 15:45:40) Douglas Sharper: If even that.
(11/19 15:45:50) Sol: I am
(11/19 15:45:54) launton: we see u bobby
(11/19 15:46:04) Douglas Sharper: Haven't been to Noloben. Only overheard things.
(11/19 15:46:16) BobbyK: glad to know it's not just me.. hehe
(11/19 15:46:17) Douglas Sharper: Sounds smaller but very interesting.
(11/19 15:46:31) Sol: Who here is a DRC council member
(11/19 15:46:40) Gregor: Is the DRC trying to hold us back, or is everything just not ready yet?
(11/19 15:47:00) Christoph05: I say they are holding us back!
(11/19 15:47:08) Sanven: wow.. busy place
(11/19 15:47:20) Garvin: both
(11/19 15:47:24) Douglas Sharper: that's their way
(11/19 15:47:42) Douglas Sharper: at least they gave me the pub.
(11/19 15:47:48) Christoph05: if we can help you to expose any deep dark secrets, let us know
(11/19 15:47:57) Douglas Sharper: for all their problems.
(11/19 15:47:59) Christoph05: do you mind if we go there once in a while?
(11/19 15:48:03) Douglas Sharper: made one right decision.
(11/19 15:48:08) Douglas Sharper: go where?
(11/19 15:48:13) Gregor: I mean, the city looks really finished, but i don't know if we'll be able to enter a t least some buildings
(11/19 15:48:15) Christoph05: To your pub
(11/19 15:48:56) From Kosh in Kosh's Relto: hrmm... anyone gota Nexus yet?
(11/19 15:49:12) Douglas Sharper: believe me, if i could bring you there i would. But as much as I hate it, the DRC runs the show.
(11/19 15:49:26) Douglas Sharper: for now.
(11/19 15:49:38) Christoph05: If w find our own way there, is it ok if we hang out there?
(11/19 15:50:02) Douglas Sharper: you can't find your way there. it's in a whole other district of the city.
(11/19 15:50:19) Douglas Sharper: J'Taeri they call it.
(11/19 15:50:37) Christoph05: Ok
(11/19 15:50:54) Douglas Sharper: In time my friend. I'm doing my best.
(11/19 15:51:29) Gregor: Douglas, is it possible that you don't have a relto with you, i can't see your's
(11/19 15:51:59) launton: hi red :)
(11/19 15:52:02) To Gregor: Yeesha can't give him a realto, they rely on Nexus
(11/19 15:52:07) Douglas Sharper: It's smarter for me not to have one.
(11/19 15:52:11) Dusante: Hey have you started any work on the bar/pub in D'ni Douglas?
(11/19 15:52:16) RedTansNax: Hi Launton. How are you doing?
(11/19 15:52:52) Gregor: I haven't been in the beta, is it possible to access the nexus with just your KI equipped
(11/19 15:53:12) Guy: No. You need a Nexus book.
(11/19 15:53:33) Heloise: Hi everybody
(11/19 15:53:39) Guy: Hi!
(11/19 15:53:44) Douglas Sharper: What's that shirt you are wearing Christoph05?
(11/19 15:53:57) Heloise: So, what's new today?
(11/19 15:53:58) Douglas Sharper: Bet the DRC doens't like that. Ha!
(11/19 15:54:12) Christoph05: It was a gift from a friend Douglas

(11/19 15:54:49) RedTansNax: Already finished the game launton?
(11/19 15:54:54) Douglas Sharper: The dead girl.
(11/19 15:55:04) Christoph05: She gave it to me after I did a few things for her
(11/19 15:55:13) Christoph05: She is very much alive Douglas
(11/19 15:55:21) Gregor: dead? for sure?
(11/19 15:55:41) Douglas Sharper: Well you think what you will. Ha. She's dead as far as I know.
(11/19 15:55:54) Dusante: everyeon is rather quite
(11/19 15:56:10) Christoph05: Narrow minded, Douglas, I thought you shared the same views... She at least is alive in memory
(11/19 15:56:10) Dusante: what do you guys think of zandi, I wonder when we will hear more from him
(11/19 15:56:18) Guy: Just observing... :)
(11/19 15:56:23) Douglas Sharper: Of course.

(11/19 15:56:54) From Danear in DRC (1) Neighborhood: nope
(11/19 15:56:55) Christoph05: So what side are you on with the DRC Douglas? For them or against them?
(11/19 15:57:04) Garvin: Douglas, will the DRC always maintain ultimate control or could they possibly be OBE?
(11/19 15:57:24) Gregor: Does the DRC let Zandi come to the city?
(11/19 15:57:32) Christoph05: I am taking notes of this conversation for people to review later
(11/19 15:57:36) Douglas Sharper: Hmmm. We'll see. For now I suppose I'm with them although I disagree with how they run things.
(11/19 15:57:36) Kha'tie: Hi there Everyone
