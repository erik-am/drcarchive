(12/10 20:27:48) To phend: Phil, shorah, are you going anywhere tonight?
(12/10 20:28:23) From phend in phend's Relto: I am resting
(12/10 20:28:31) From phend in phend's Relto: how are you?
(12/10 20:28:42) To phend: Oh, sorry to bother you, are feeling ok?
(12/10 20:28:56) From phend in phend's Relto: yes
(12/10 20:29:08) From phend in phend's Relto: maybe I will go somewhere now
(12/10 20:29:21) To phend: Good, I had no chance to meet you in person, would you tell me where are you going?
(12/10 20:29:38) From phend in phend's Relto: where would you like me to go?
(12/10 20:29:46) From phend in phend's Relto: do you have a neighborhood?
(12/10 20:30:17) To phend: I have trouble keeping connected, when there are a lot of people...
(12/10 20:30:44) To phend: I don't have a personal hood, I'm in Vision (4) hood. Would you like to meet at Maverick?
(12/10 20:31:16) From phend in phend's Relto: sure
(12/10 20:31:38) From phend in phend's Relto: I'm going there
(12/10 20:31:41) To phend: OK, thanks, I'm going there and see if I can survive. Will Douglas come?
(12/10 20:32:08) From phend in phend's Relto: no - he isn't with me
(12/10 20:34:32) phend: hello
(12/10 20:34:46) To phend: Shorah b'shemtee
(12/10 20:35:01) phend: I'm Phil
(12/10 20:35:25) To phend: Hi I'm Ayli, how are yoiu doing?
(12/10 20:36:08) To phend: I heard that Douglas completed his journey
(12/10 20:36:16) phend: I'm fine - yes he did
(12/10 20:36:24) phend: it was interesting for him
(12/10 20:36:28) To phend: Was anything new discovered?
(12/10 20:36:38) phend: I think he learned some things
(12/10 20:36:51) To phend: Like what?
(12/10 20:36:57) phend: only what those who complete their journey see and hear
(12/10 20:37:05) phend: but he didn't know Yeesha
(12/10 20:37:42) phend: so now he understands what she is about
(12/10 20:37:48) To phend: Have you seen anything unusual during your absence?
(12/10 20:38:16) phend: I was only surprised to find that so many were now in D'ni
(12/10 20:38:31) phend: When I left there were very few
(12/10 20:38:45) To phend: very few of what?
(12/10 20:39:00) phend: explorers
(12/10 20:39:13) Ayli: Oh, yes, we are growing in numbers
(12/10 20:39:25) phend: Today many more have come?
(12/10 20:39:31) phend: When did you come?
(12/10 20:40:07) Ayli: Oh, well, a little less than an earth- year
(12/10 20:40:30) Ayli: I would say 11 months
(12/10 20:41:00) phend: You've been exploring before the new start
(12/10 20:41:17) Ayli: Phil, have you met Yeesha in person?
(12/10 20:41:41) phend: Yes, haven't you?
(12/10 20:42:16) Ayli: Well, yes, but she was the only one who talked, I couldn't ask her questions
(12/10 20:42:44) phend: She left quickly
(12/10 20:43:00) Ayli: Phil, would you like to sit, so as not to expend your energy?
(12/10 20:43:06) phend: have you seen the least?
(12/10 20:43:17) Ayli: Yes, of course, but from a far, you?
(12/10 20:43:30) phend: far and close
(12/10 20:43:47) Ayli: Did you learn their language?
(12/10 20:43:51) phend: I am okay standing - I have to go soon
(12/10 20:43:58) phend: no
(12/10 20:44:24) phend: I don't know if they speak a language
(12/10 20:44:38) Ayli: Oh, I appreciate so much to finally meeting you... Where are you going to go, if I may ask?
(12/10 20:45:21) Ayli: Yes it sounded more like a growl, but all the intelligent species develop a language, isn't it?
(12/10 20:45:51) phend: I don't know
(12/10 20:46:02) phend: how do you know intelligence?
(12/10 20:46:14) phend: by speech? by action?
(12/10 20:46:30) Ayli: Communication, building things, society, civilization...
(12/10 20:47:13) Ayli: If they could organize themselves and fight oppressors, it is an itelligence, isn't it?
(12/10 20:47:20) phend: is a single man on an island intelligent?
(12/10 20:47:47) Ayli starts to laugh
(12/10 20:47:47) Ayli: it depends, maybe he rights on the sand...
(12/10 20:47:59) Ayli: I mean writes
(12/10 20:48:12) phend: to who?
(12/10 20:48:24) phend: maybe he only fishes and laughs
(12/10 20:48:31) Ayli: Hey you can talk to yourself in ectreme curcumstances
(12/10 20:48:50) phend: yes
(12/10 20:49:07) phend: talking :)
(12/10 20:49:08) Ayli: Well, men is intelligent in general as a species
(12/10 20:49:27) Ayli: I can't hear you. I don't think the sound in the KI is working
(12/10 20:49:42) phend: because they speak, and use tools, and build things?
(12/10 20:50:06) phend: the bahro are not like men
(12/10 20:50:23) Ayli: Where did they came from? Which age?
(12/10 20:50:51) phend: i don't know, but they are here
(12/10 20:50:59) phend: maybe from here?
(12/10 20:51:03) Ayli: Hello,
(12/10 20:51:06) phend: hello
(12/10 20:51:09) Ayli: Moranda?
(12/10 20:51:21) Moranda: hi Aylie and phend
(12/10 20:51:26) Moranda: yes it is Moranda
(12/10 20:51:36) Ayli: I can't see the name only the ID, I guessed right, hello Moranda
(12/10 20:51:46) phend: Hello Moranda, you are wearing her clothing
(12/10 20:51:58) Moranda: yes.....I wear her gift
(12/10 20:52:15) phend: How long have you been in D'ni?
(12/10 20:52:26) Moranda: long time

(12/10 20:54:23) phend: you are concerned?
(12/10 20:54:58) Moranda: I do not understand where things are going
(12/10 20:55:31) phend: no one knows where things are going - only the Maker knows where things might go
(12/10 20:55:37) Ayli: Shorah whoever linked in, can't see the name
(12/10 20:55:59) Moranda: yes...............but so many ideas.......who to follow.............not sure
(12/10 20:56:16) phend: hello
(12/10 20:56:27) Tink: Is Tink

(12/10 20:56:47) Moranda waves
(12/10 20:56:56) Tink: ~<8o} always look for the lavender
(12/10 20:57:02) Tink waves
(12/10 20:57:09) Moranda: lavender is good.......for Tink
(12/10 20:57:24) Tink: What be happening guys?
(12/10 20:57:25) phend: you are not a maverick - only in that neighborhood Tink
(12/10 20:57:43) Tink: Oh, Tink be maverick all right
(12/10 20:57:46) Moranda: not much
(12/10 20:58:04) phend: I don't think mavericks wear lavender
(12/10 20:58:07) Tink: How has Mr Henderson's day gone so far?
(12/10 20:58:20) Tink: They do in DaDungeon!
(12/10 20:58:29) phend: good - I talked with many people this morning with Douglas
(12/10 20:58:46) Ayli: What about, Phil?
(12/10 20:58:47) Tink: Cool . . . what did you all say?
(12/10 20:58:48) phend: maybe I will wear lavender - I am a maverick
(12/10 20:59:07) Tink: Mr Henderson, you wear whatever suits you
(12/10 20:59:31) Tink: Maybe lavender sandals?
(12/10 20:59:35) phend: you call me Mr. Henderson, but most people call me Phil. Why?
(12/10 21:00:11) Tink: We haven't been properly introduced . . . and you haven't given me permission to call you by your first name
(12/10 21:00:23) phend: hello, I am Phil
(12/10 21:00:38) Tink: lol . . .glad ta meetcha, Phil!
(12/10 21:00:48) phend: nice to meet you Tink
(12/10 21:01:18) phend: can we play the game - I haven't tried it
(12/10 21:01:31) Moranda: the game is fun
(12/10 21:01:34) Tink: Back to the question? What did you and Douglas say to others this morning, Tink asks curiously
(12/10 21:01:40) Ayli: Oh, yes, lets do it
(12/10 21:01:46) Tink: what game . . .somebody needing heek points?
(12/10 21:02:09) Tink: I gotta a bunch easily won
(12/10 21:02:10) Ayli: Yeah, I lost last time I played /sad
(12/10 21:02:10) phend: Well... Douglas talked a lot about telling others. Letting others know about her.
(12/10 21:02:23) phend: And some people seemed angry
(12/10 21:02:28) Tink: the lady of The Least?
(12/10 21:02:38) phend: yes
(12/10 21:02:38) Tink: people do that
(12/10 21:02:38) Moranda: What did he say to make them angry?
(12/10 21:03:09) phend: About "sides" and the DRC
(12/10 21:03:28) Moranda: Ah, i see
(12/10 21:03:33) phend: some want the DRC to follow her
(12/10 21:03:40) Tink: well, some don't like the feeling of being "herded"
(12/10 21:03:56) Tink: Tink IS maverick
(12/10 21:04:02) Moranda: I do not believe the DRC will do that..........
(12/10 21:04:15) phend: we are all free to chose - it is a gift. But there are always limits
(12/10 21:04:24) Moranda: agreed
(12/10 21:04:34) Tink: I know . . . but the angry ones don't
(12/10 21:04:54) Tink: Which limits do you refer to, Phil?
(12/10 21:05:03) phend: but the angry ones were for the DRC
(12/10 21:05:40) phend: i would like the DRC to follow her, but I don't know what they will do
(12/10 21:05:50) phend: limits in everything
(12/10 21:05:59) Tink: did they perceive a "threat" to their original benefactors? The ones who in reality started the way to get here?
(12/10 21:06:03) phend: whether in D'ni or on the surface
(12/10 21:06:17) phend: yes
(12/10 21:06:24) Tink: Well, Phil . . . keep trying!
(12/10 21:06:29) Tink: Talking is good
(12/10 21:06:39) phend: for a while
(12/10 21:06:45) phend: action is better
(12/10 21:06:58) Tink: Ummm . . . what kind of action?
(12/10 21:07:19) phend: there can sometimes be too much talk, but then what comes of it?
(12/10 21:07:46) Moranda: sounds like my father, he hated all talk and no action
(12/10 21:07:48) Tink: Tink starts messin' around . . . ~<;o}
(12/10 21:08:03) phend: is there another Tink?
(12/10 21:08:20) Tink: Oh geez, I HOPE not!
(12/10 21:08:21) Ayli: I think talk leads to understanding
(12/10 21:08:29) phend: Sometimes
(12/10 21:08:38) Tink: Ayli is right . . . good talk does just that
(12/10 21:08:38) phend: but what if it doesn't?
(12/10 21:08:42) Moranda: some learn better from seeing
(12/10 21:09:17) phend: when children do not learn from talk, then what do parents do?
(12/10 21:09:18) Ayli: We can learn by studying
(12/10 21:09:26) Tink: A different way of saying what you want to say?
(12/10 21:09:52) Moranda: demonstrate :-)
(12/10 21:10:00) phend: this best way to learn is by following - yes
(12/10 21:10:12) Tink: You be a redhead . . . redheads can think of lotsa ways to do a thing . . . like talking . . . and demonstrating
(12/10 21:10:34) Tink: :)
(12/10 21:10:36) phend: and if the example is someone who does rather than talks - this is the best
(12/10 21:10:40) Moranda: he is a red head
(12/10 21:11:15) Tink: There be three of us here . . .tell us what you want us redheads plus one to do, Phil
(12/10 21:11:18) Moranda: but if we are to follow, what are we to do, who is going to show us?
(12/10 21:11:41) phend: maybe you should do what I do
(12/10 21:12:00) Ayli: What is it Phil?
(12/10 21:12:14) Moranda: and this is?
(12/10 21:12:15) Tink: And what is that, asks one who usually travels her own path?
(12/10 21:12:46) phend: right now I am telling about her, to all who will listen. But after that...
(12/10 21:12:58) phend: we will see who will listen and follow her
(12/10 21:13:10) Tink: Tell we three about her
(12/10 21:13:13) Moranda: yes, after the telling
(12/10 21:13:18) phend: and see where it leads
(12/10 21:13:24) Moranda: tell us
(12/10 21:13:33) Moranda: are we to walk a blind path?
(12/10 21:13:56) phend: i don't know the future - but I know she has plans
(12/10 21:13:57) Moranda: I have heard what she said, and am trying to understand
(12/10 21:13:57) phend: i don't know the future - but I know she has plans
(12/10 21:13:59) phend: i don't know the future - but I know she has plans
(12/10 21:14:01) Tink: Convinve Tink and Tink'll babble it everywhere . . . right along with you
(12/10 21:14:03) phend: i don't know the future - but I know she has plans
(12/10 21:14:11) phend: i don't know the future - but I know she has plans
(12/10 21:14:22) Moranda: uh no.........Phil has an echo
(12/10 21:14:37) Tink: do you know anything of her plan?
(12/10 21:14:45) Ayli: Oh, that is not a good sign, I thought that only I saw that
(12/10 21:15:01) phend: I am going to wear lavander sandals from now on
(12/10 21:15:01) phend: I am going to wear lavander sandals from now on
(12/10 21:15:04) phend: I am going to wear lavander sandals from now on
(12/10 21:15:08) phend: I am going to wear lavander sandals from now on
(12/10 21:15:10) Moranda: cool
(12/10 21:15:11) Tink laughs
(12/10 21:15:14) Ayli starts to laugh
(12/10 21:15:16) phend: I am going to wear lavander sandals from now on
(12/10 21:15:25) Tink: see I may be converting YOU!
(12/10 21:15:26) Moranda: now.......what of her plans?
(12/10 21:15:44) Moranda: we need more information, if we are to help
(12/10 21:16:07) phend: I will play one game if you want to
(12/10 21:16:08) phend: I will play one game if you want to
(12/10 21:16:10) phend: I will play one game if you want to
(12/10 21:16:14) phend: I will play one game if you want to
(12/10 21:16:18) phend: do they have a game here?
(12/10 21:16:19) Ayli: Yes
(12/10 21:16:19) phend: do they have a game here?
(12/10 21:16:21) phend: do they have a game here?
(12/10 21:16:22) phend: I will play one game if you want to
(12/10 21:16:24) Moranda: lyes
(12/10 21:16:25) phend: do they have a game here?
(12/10 21:16:28) Tink: Do any include explorers?
(12/10 21:16:33) phend: do they have a game here?
(12/10 21:16:43) phend: are you all whispering to each other?
(12/10 21:16:44) phend: are you all whispering to each other?
(12/10 21:16:46) phend: are you all whispering to each other?
(12/10 21:16:49) phend: I can't hear you
(12/10 21:16:50) phend: I can't hear you
(12/10 21:16:50) phend: are you all whispering to each other?
(12/10 21:16:52) phend: I can't hear you
(12/10 21:16:56) Moranda: n
(12/10 21:16:56) phend: I can't hear you
(12/10 21:16:58) phend: are you all whispering to each other?
(12/10 21:17:02) Ayli: I don't see Phil, anyone?
(12/10 21:17:04) phend: I can't hear you
(12/10 21:17:11) Tink: nope, phil . . . but I wonder where you went?
(12/10 21:17:11) Moranda: phil is gone
(12/10 21:17:22) Ayli: He is not on the KI list
(12/10 21:17:27) Moranda: whre are you?
(12/10 21:17:29) Tink: shall we whisper to one another?
(12/10 21:17:39) Ayli: "/wisper"
(12/10 21:17:49) Tink: =)
(12/10 21:18:18) Ayli: Phil is gone, right?
(12/10 21:18:32) Tink: phooey . . . thought maybe he's leave an island page for a minute or two.
(12/10 21:18:32) Ayli: I think the echo did it :-(
(12/10 21:18:32) Moranda: my Ki says he is off line
(12/10 21:18:44) Tink: What makes an echo?
(12/10 21:18:57) Moranda: think maybe we got too pushy
(12/10 21:19:09) Ayli: The "age power" is fluctuating
(12/10 21:19:17) Moranda: yah
(12/10 21:19:33) Moranda: I was really shocked to see him when I linked in here
(12/10 21:19:41) Tink: That's what happens when one gets to talking with an inquisitive mind like Tink's
(12/10 21:19:50) Moranda: hehehe
(12/10 21:19:58) Moranda: I wanna know, dang it
(12/10 21:20:26) Tink: We'll keep working on him . . . stay on his trail whenever you see his name pop up on your buddy list
