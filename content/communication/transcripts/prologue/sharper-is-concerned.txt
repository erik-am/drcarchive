(11/26 18:43:38) To VuVo: got it
(11/26 18:43:45) Douglas Sharper: Can I be honest?
(11/26 18:43:49) Miroku: Are they really THAT sensitive?
(11/26 18:43:54) Alan: Of course you can.
(11/26 18:43:54) Rivenchan: I wont tell
(11/26 18:44:00) Guiun: I don'tknow, can you?
(11/26 18:44:00) Rivenchan: ^_^
(11/26 18:44:13) VuVo: *no one will tell*
(11/26 18:44:14) Douglas Sharper: I don't know many of you or where you stand. I talk as though you all have issues with the DRC and that isn't smart.
(11/26 18:44:26) Douglas Sharper: Many of you could go to them with things I've said.
(11/26 18:44:34) Douglas Sharper: That gets me in trouble.
(11/26 18:44:42) Rivenchan: I think a lot of us arn't exactly pleased with how the DRC is handleing us
(11/26 18:44:42) Alan: I have issues with the DRC treating me as if I were a 2 year old unable to take care of myself.
(11/26 18:44:52) Guiun: I love the DRC
(11/26 18:44:55) Guiun: :P
(11/26 18:45:11) Douglas Sharper: Well a lot have issues and a lot don't.
(11/26 18:45:13) VuVo: Why would you be saying things the DRC wouldn't like?
(11/26 18:45:20) Guiun: Except they're a little to lax.
(11/26 18:45:25) Guiun: too lax
(11/26 18:45:37) Guiun roars with laughter
(11/26 18:45:45) Miroku: I have concerns about the way they are handling things.
(11/26 18:45:46) Douglas Sharper: The DRC is touchy. Any little thing can be taken as "bad".
(11/26 18:45:51) Douglas Sharper: Many do.
(11/26 18:46:09) Rivenchan: If you don't want to talk about the DRC, we could talk about Yeesha and Zandi ^_^ I'm sure they wont mind if we say bad things about them, would they?
(11/26 18:46:19) Alan: Could they keep you out of D'ni if they wanted to, Douglas?
(11/26 18:46:23) VuVo: So your advise is what exactly?
(11/26 18:46:38) Douglas Sharper: I know Yeesha wouldn't care.
(11/26 18:46:55) Daedalus: I don't see how anyone would have the power to kick someone from D'ni
(11/26 18:46:57) Daedalus: i dunno
(11/26 18:47:08) Miroku: I worry that they are in danger of becoming power-drunk
(11/26 18:47:08) Rivenchan: I meant the DRC - the DRC doesn't seem to enjoy what Zandi's doing
(11/26 18:47:15) Daedalus: they're not governing, just restoring
(11/26 18:47:27) Alan: Well I noticed that Douglas isn't wearing a Linking book like the rest of us.
(11/26 18:47:29) Douglas Sharper: No advice really. Just follow the line for now.
(11/26 18:47:31) Rivenchan: So i doubt they would mind what your opinions of Zandi and Yeesha are
(11/26 18:47:34) Daedalus: but they ACT like they're governing
(11/26 18:48:00) Douglas Sharper: Zandi: the guy bugs the DRC and I like that.
(11/26 18:48:10) Douglas Sharper: Yeesha: dead lady so I don't care much.
(11/26 18:48:11) Alan: We don't have much choice about following the line until they get rid of more of these cones and barricades anyway.
(11/26 18:48:24) 75th Trombone: Well it is sorta their gig. I mean I have "issues" like anyone else, but I haven't seen anything egregious enough to warrant quite THIS much consternation... ...maybe I've just not paid enough attention
(11/26 18:48:34) Rivenchan: I've heard rumors that Yeesha isn't really dead
(11/26 18:49:01) 75th Trombone: so've I
(11/26 18:49:05) Douglas Sharper: I've heard rumors she is really dead.
(11/26 18:49:21) Rivenchan: Who all thinks she's really dead?
(11/26 18:49:25) Miroku: I have every intention of following the rules, but I want to know why the rules are in place. The word "safety" is not sufficient to allay my fears.
(11/26 18:49:32) Guiun: I hope she's dead
(11/26 18:49:37) Alan: Good point, Miroku.
(11/26 18:49:38) Rivenchan: Have you found journals confirming it?
(11/26 18:49:39) Guiun: *is evil*
(11/26 18:49:57) Douglas Sharper: Not me.
(11/26 18:50:03) Rivenchan: Has anyone?
(11/26 18:50:24) VuVo: Not one way or the other.
(11/26 18:50:26) Douglas Sharper: She's supposed to be two hundred and some years old or something. What more proof do you want?
(11/26 18:50:49) VuVo: 350 wouldnt' be unknown.
(11/26 18:50:49) 75th Trombone: We don't know how the long d'ni lifespans may or may not have been diluted in Yeesha's genes
(11/26 18:50:51) Alan: Uh, don't the D'ni live longer than that?
(11/26 18:50:54) Miroku: Time IS relative.
(11/26 18:51:01) Rivenchan: (laughs) you are talking about a decendant from a race that routinely made it to that age
(11/26 18:51:04) Guiun: she's not d'ni
(11/26 18:51:07) Douglas Sharper: Yeesha has a touch of the D'ni blood.
(11/26 18:51:22) Rivenchan: Long life might be a dominant trait
(11/26 18:51:23) Alan: Well Catherine was only supposed to be slightly less longer lived than Atrus.
(11/26 18:51:30) Guiun: Heh - she's touched all right....
(11/26 18:51:32) D'ehgan: but not pure D'ni
(11/26 18:51:35) VuVo: I hope I look that good at 200
(11/26 18:51:38) Rivenchan: i mean, we dont exactly know how long gehn, sirrus, or achenar lived
(11/26 18:51:38) Douglas Sharper: And Atrus didn't live that long.
(11/26 18:51:41) Alan: And Yeesha being their daughter, she's 3/4 D'ni.
(11/26 18:51:49) Rivenchan: How long did Atrus live?
(11/26 18:51:51) 75th Trombone: How long DID Atrus live? And how did he die?
(11/26 18:52:07) devon: Catherine wasn't D'ni.
(11/26 18:52:07) Douglas Sharper: Atrus was 1/4 D'ni.
(11/26 18:52:19) Rivenchan: umm.. so?
(11/26 18:52:20) Alan: Ok, I knew my math had gone sour somewhere.
(11/26 18:52:34) Alan: (like, 15 years ago)
(11/26 18:52:43) Rivenchan: just because my mother is 5 ft and my dad is 6ft doesn't mean i have to be 5'6" ^_~
(11/26 18:52:43) Douglas Sharper: Either eway I don't buy women living 200 years and running all over Ages.
(11/26 18:52:45) VuVo: lol
(11/26 18:52:46) Douglas Sharper: Sorry.
(11/26 18:53:00) VuVo: HOld on...
(11/26 18:53:03) Alan: So are you saying there are NO D'ni living now?
(11/26 18:53:11) 75th Trombone: Doug, it might do your cause good to not be quiiiite so impetuous in your opinion-forming...
(11/26 18:53:16) Douglas Sharper: Not saying that.
(11/26 18:53:30) Alan: Good, cause didn't Marie write that she thinks she met one?
(11/26 18:53:41) Jensen: who did you meet that you talked about in you journal?
(11/26 18:53:43) Douglas Sharper: I'm not going to fudge my opinion to try and gain friends like the DRC.
(11/26 18:53:48) D'ehgan: aaaaaaaaa
(11/26 18:54:07) Rivenchan: But you're fudging your opinions because youre afraid of the DRC
(11/26 18:54:12) 75th Trombone: Sounds like you're slightly fudging your opinion=---- yep
(11/26 18:54:12) Douglas Sharper: DRC is being real quiet. But I think they've met one.
(11/26 18:54:25) Alan: He's not fudging, he's just not giving his opinions.
(11/26 18:54:46) D'ehgan cheers
(11/26 18:54:55) VuVo: Careful Doug. This might be one of those things that will come back to haunt you.
(11/26 18:55:02) Douglas Sharper: Not fudging my opinion - fudging my public voice.
(11/26 18:55:05) Miroku: I don't want you to tell me what I want to hear, I want to know the facts.
(11/26 18:55:06) Alan: Douglas, just speculation, but might the D'ni not like the fact that we've taken up residence in their ancestral home?
(11/26 18:55:11) Rivenchan: Have you heard any news recently about the D'ni survivor?
(11/26 18:55:17) Douglas Sharper: If you want to talk in private, I'll be glad too.
(11/26 18:55:29) Douglas Sharper: I wouldn't.
(11/26 18:55:34) Rivenchan: I'd love to talk privately ^_^
(11/26 18:55:35) Miroku: I'd like that.
(11/26 18:55:35) Douglas Sharper: Alan - I wouldn't.
(11/26 18:55:47) Alan: Yeah, me either... Food for thought.
(11/26 18:56:02) Douglas Sharper: Maybe one of you should start a place where we can talk about the DRC without their knowledge.
(11/26 18:56:12) 75th Trombone: I was thinking about that yesterday
(11/26 18:56:13) Alan: How can we do that?
(11/26 18:56:13) Guiun: the d'ni wouldn't have a say in us being here. they blew up the place and left
(11/26 18:56:32) Rivenchan: News spreads like wildfire in this carvern - if the DRC keeps their ears open, they'd find out about anywhere we could start up
(11/26 18:56:46) Alan: Guiun, most of them were forced out by the plague, weren't they?
(11/26 18:56:47) Douglas Sharper: There is always something on the surface.
(11/26 18:57:00) D'ehgan: thier ears and eyes are everywhere
(11/26 18:57:03) Guiun: lol sure - that's what they WANT you to think
(11/26 18:57:11) 75th Trombone: birds... ..beasts... ;)
(11/26 18:57:14) Rivenchan: no offence, but the DRC also has internet access ^_~
(11/26 18:57:30) Alan: What we really need is an Age that the DRC doesn't know about.
(11/26 18:57:30) Rivenchan: Unless we passcoded everything, i think it would be silly to assume the DRC wouldn't find out
(11/26 18:57:47) Douglas Sharper: Well that's the tough part isn't it?
(11/26 18:57:54) Douglas Sharper: Tough be ruled by Big Brother.
(11/26 18:57:57) Neema: What about in the neighborhoods, I have heard rumor of a private meeting area in the hoods
(11/26 18:58:08) Jensen: Who knows? maybe I am a DRC member in disguise!
(11/26 18:58:10) Guiun: oh yeah....
(11/26 18:58:15) Rivenchan: Why do you believe the DRC to be Big Brother?
(11/26 18:58:17) Douglas Sharper: Exactly.
(11/26 18:58:20) Alan: The neighborhoods that the DRC is setting up webcams in all the time? Those neighborhoods?
(11/26 18:58:21) Jensen: we have to take some risk
(11/26 18:58:23) 75th Trombone: Victor would notice, he'd be able to see the new neighborhood and wonder why so many people are there
(11/26 18:58:31) Douglas Sharper: Aren't you the one who just said they find out everything?
(11/26 18:58:42) Guiun: lol
(11/26 18:58:52) Rivenchan: I said that can find out anything, i didn't say that they were intentionally watching us
(11/26 18:59:00) Douglas Sharper: Please.
(11/26 18:59:07) Rivenchan: Do you think they are?
(11/26 18:59:20) 75th Trombone: well I would be if a bunch of yahoos were in a cavern I was restoring ;-)
(11/26 18:59:29) Douglas Sharper: Right.
(11/26 18:59:34) Rivenchan: lol, that's true ^_^
(11/26 18:59:47) 75th Trombone: that doesnt' make 'em bad though. Not to say there's not other stuff going on.
(11/26 19:00:09) Douglas Sharper: Of course.
(11/26 19:00:14) Guiun: I hope they are watching me at all times. that way if I fall an break a nail, they can save me.
(11/26 19:00:21) Douglas Sharper: Ha
(11/26 19:00:32) Alan: haha, we We could always appropriate a webforum... Something unrelated to D'ni or the DRC...
(11/26 19:00:46) Rivenchan: lol
(11/26 19:01:02) Rivenchan: i'd pity the people who were using the forum before we nabbed it bleh.gif
(11/26 19:01:16) Alan: Maybe some NASA forum or something :)
(11/26 19:01:16) 75th Trombone: you mean a ""meeting place"" that the DRC wouldn't ""find""?
(11/26 19:01:26) Douglas Sharper: I like you Alan.
(11/26 19:01:34) Alan: Thank you, Douglas.
(11/26 19:01:39) Douglas Sharper: Clever man.
(11/26 19:01:41) Rivenchan: If the DRC is always watching us, is it even safe to discuss this here?
(11/26 19:01:48) Miroku: What about someone's Relto?
(11/26 19:02:02) Alan: Well its not like I'm saying here, go to this NASA forum and start a DRC discussion thread...
(11/26 19:02:06) 75th Trombone: Doug might not appreciate that..
(11/26 19:02:17) 75th Trombone: Alan> we get it ;)
(11/26 19:02:18) Douglas Sharper: Only if someone from here tells them what was said. And then we know somewhere here isn't trustworthy.
(11/26 19:02:27) Alan: I'm suggesting an alternative to holding suspicious meetings in a cavern that the DRC has complete access to.
(11/26 19:02:37) 75th Trombone: Yep
(11/26 19:02:59) Miroku: The DRC doesn't have access to Relto's , ....or do they?
(11/26 19:03:14) 75th Trombone: a """meeting place""" .... ...that the DRC could only ""find"" if someone roots it out from within
(11/26 19:03:16) Rivenchan: I dont think they do
(11/26 19:03:41) VuVo: lol
(11/26 19:03:58) Jensen: Sharper: what do you think of Zandi?
(11/26 19:04:19) Douglas Sharper: Interesting man.
(11/26 19:05:10) Alan: Douglas, did you ever meet his father?
(11/26 19:05:25) Douglas Sharper: Never had the chance.
(11/26 19:05:49) Douglas Sharper: Of course he is why we are all here.
(11/26 19:06:03) Rivenchan: How did you form bonds with the DRC in the first place?
(11/26 19:06:19) Alan: Well, he and an almost extinct race of humans from before recorded history.
(11/26 19:06:29) Douglas Sharper: Was a very early visitor. Back in the early days.
(11/26 19:06:49) Rivenchan: But why did the DRC let you visit?
(11/26 19:06:56) Rivenchan: Or did you sneak down? ^_~
(11/26 19:07:01) Alan: Oh, Douglas, sorry for breaking into your safe in Teledahn.
(11/26 19:07:06) Guiun: *gasps*
(11/26 19:07:12) Alan: :)
(11/26 19:07:39) Miroku: You predate the DRC, don't you?
(11/26 19:08:13) Miroku: That is, you came down before the founding of the DRC
(11/26 19:08:54) Douglas Sharper: Around the same time.
(11/26 19:09:12) Douglas Sharper: Well I need to be heading off. Have a meeting with someone.
(11/26 19:09:21) Alan: Thanks for stopping in, Douglas.
(11/26 19:09:27) Alan: It was nice to finally meet you.
(11/26 19:09:30) Miroku: Good to meet you.
(11/26 19:09:31) D'ehgan: good luck
(11/26 19:09:33) VuVo: Good talking with you Doug.
(11/26 19:09:35) Douglas Sharper: Good to meet you all.
(11/26 19:09:35) Rivenchan: I hope the meeting the DRC is having about you goes well
(11/26 19:09:37) Neema: Later DS
(11/26 19:09:39) Douglas Sharper: Talk to you later.
