(12/11 19:30:15) Douglas Sharper: Which is what we fight.
(12/11 19:30:17) Douglas Sharper cheers
(12/11 19:30:21) Guivin: Or break their hold and take it back?
(12/11 19:30:21) Brian Fioca: pride and power of the DRC...
(12/11 19:30:30) Thanakar: was it the Bahro's in the first place Guivin?
(12/11 19:30:31) Tweek: Im afraid I still feel we need the DRC...need to work together
(12/11 19:30:35) Dan'ni: DRC will not control us!
(12/11 19:30:36) Eltheras: How do the other DRC members feel about this Doug? Nick, Tricia, ect...
(12/11 19:30:43) Brian Fioca: the DRC will come around
(12/11 19:30:54) TheEggplant: full circle
(12/11 19:30:54) Douglas Sharper: They will have to tell you how they feel. I can't speak for them.
(12/11 19:31:00) Douglas Sharper: Many are still deciding.
(12/11 19:31:06) Douglas Sharper: Listening.
(12/11 19:31:12) Pa'lua: Yes and some are against us.
(12/11 19:31:15) Guivin: What about the D'ni themselves? What do they think about this? I wonder if they are apologetic? After all, they chose not to rebuild the cavern and moved along.
(12/11 19:31:19) Brian Fioca: the more of us there are to spread the message, the more they will listen
(12/11 19:31:24) Tweek: better to look before you leap Doug
(12/11 19:31:27) Thanakar: the D'ni are long gone Guivin
(12/11 19:31:34) Dan'ni: the DRC has to listen or else they're fools
(12/11 19:31:41) Guivin: Actually, they are living in another age that Atrus wrote.
(12/11 19:31:43) phend: maybe the DRC will be part of this voice... and maybe not...
(12/11 19:31:44) kami: marie said there was one about
(12/11 19:31:46) Cyman: Wow second day here, im kinda confused but maybe some can help me understand. I listen to her again.
(12/11 19:31:51) Douglas Sharper: I am leaping Tweek. There is no stopping now. I have looked.
(12/11 19:32:03) Thanakar: one in Noloben
(12/11 19:32:17) phend: others can tell Cyman what has happened
(12/11 19:32:20) Dan'ni: I wonder what the DRC did to the D'ni on Noloben
(12/11 19:32:29) Thanakar: ask Marie
(12/11 19:32:32) Douglas Sharper: Once the DRC allows others to talk to the D'ni in Noloben we will, of course, speak with him or her.
(12/11 19:32:32) Dan'ni: they don't seem to be willing to talk about this
(12/11 19:32:35) Pa'lua: I don't know, Marie wouldn't say.
(12/11 19:32:36) Tweek: Doug> good for you. Im glad you can make your decision...myself however...I shall continue to listen, to learn..
(12/11 19:32:38) Guivin: What about Releeshan?
(12/11 19:32:40) Douglas Sharper: Hopefully it will not be too late.
(12/11 19:33:12) Douglas Sharper: Hopefully their warped views will not persuade this living D'ni.
(12/11 19:33:22) Dan'ni: if it wasnt for the messsage you left in your office Doug we'd never find out about the D'no on Noloben - the DRC would keep it a secret... maybe even forever!
(12/11 19:33:28) Tweek: Doug> What are the DRC's views?
(12/11 19:33:29) Brian Fioca: we need to get them to allow us access
(12/11 19:33:34) Pa'lua: Can Yeesha reach this D'ni on Noloben?
(12/11 19:33:41) Douglas Sharper: Very well Tweek. Do not make a decision until you are sure you want to.
(12/11 19:33:50) Douglas Sharper: Yeesha can reach anywhere.
(12/11 19:33:57) Thanakar: hrm..must be only getting half that...
(12/11 19:33:57) Brian Fioca: ahh
(12/11 19:34:12) Thanakar: Having second thoughts Tweek?
(12/11 19:34:17) LaReh: My decision is made, I side with the daughter of Atrus
(12/11 19:34:22) MrM3FaN: Doug>Will we be able to do that in time?
(12/11 19:34:24) kami: well i kinda like her to reach in here
(12/11 19:34:41) Dan'ni: *high fives LaReh*
(12/11 19:34:46) Pa'lua: Then Yeesha should seek the D'ni on Noloben and convince him to not listen to the DRC.
(12/11 19:35:34) Tweek: interesting...yes yes..we are most interested...but there seem to be a lot of tapping of the feet and no actual dancing however
(12/11 19:35:43) Douglas Sharper: In that case.

(12/11 19:38:53) Douglas Sharper: There are many new visitors today. We must speak with them. Get to them before the DRC.
(12/11 19:39:00) Brian Fioca: yes
(12/11 19:39:16) Dan'ni: Victor already visited one of the hoods Doug
(12/11 19:39:27) Dan'ni: I'm afraid they already got to some of the new exlorers

(12/11 19:40:17) Dan'ni: but I'm sure the nw explorers will find decide to trust Yesha in the end
(12/11 19:40:20) Pa'lua: We must help Phil and Doug spread the word.
(12/11 19:40:22) Thanakar: 'hrm..phil has become a stature
(12/11 19:40:27) Thanakar: statue

(12/11 19:41:30) Dan'ni: I bet he visited the Guild of Greeters hood
(12/11 19:41:31) Pa'lua: So is there anything specifically we should do Phil?

(12/11 19:41:48) Guivin: Hey, does anyone here know where to find the island page for your Relto?
(12/11 19:42:18) sobeone: sweet
(12/11 19:42:30) Dan'ni: Phil, the pages are gone again... perhaps you could make them repapear? It'd definatelly please the new explorers
(12/11 19:42:47) LaReh: I agree
(12/11 19:42:52) Thanakar: eh kami?
(12/11 19:42:55) Pa'lua: Yes, it needs to be nurtured and cared for.
(12/11 19:44:20) Brian Fioca: so we must gather more followers, I"m afraid the DRC are doing just that as we speak
(12/11 19:44:30) Douglas Sharper: What did he say?
(12/11 19:44:32) Pa'lua: Thank is something I learned about IMForeman....he was one of the very few explorers that the DRC let in and I don't think he likes the rest of us being here.
(12/11 19:44:34) Tweek: would anyone complain if I put green food colouring in the lake?
(12/11 19:44:46) Thanakar: he said the DRC currently controls the link books so we have to play by their rules
(12/11 19:44:50) Douglas Sharper: In time you may be able to Tweek
(12/11 19:44:54) Thanakar: I liked the word 'currently'
(12/11 19:44:59) kami: lol
(12/11 19:45:03) TheEggplant: Green water is not pretty to look at though.
(12/11 19:45:03) Tweek: Doug> spiffy ^_^
(12/11 19:45:16) Dan'ni: DRC doesn't control them... Yeesha can do anythig she wants
(12/11 19:45:19) Dan'ni: I believe in her
(12/11 19:45:21) Tweek: it wouldnt be green...it'll be yukky brown
(12/11 19:45:28) Dan'ni: and I believe that she won't let the DRC hold the Ages from us
(12/11 19:45:31) Douglas Sharper: There is a Silo in the cavern. You'll be surprised at what you can do there.
(12/11 19:45:37) Thanakar: 'ooooo!
(12/11 19:45:41) Thanakar: nice
(12/11 19:45:45) Thanakar: Silo...
(12/11 19:45:51) kami: silo?
(12/11 19:45:52) Pa'lua: Do you know when we'll have access?
(12/11 19:45:55) Dan'ni: interesting... anoher secret of the DRC?
(12/11 19:45:58) MrM3FaN: Thats would be cool to go and see
(12/11 19:46:24) Douglas Sharper: Another piece of information they do not share.
(12/11 19:46:28) TheEggplant: where is the silo?
(12/11 19:46:31) Thanakar: lots of stuff inthe cavern they don't share
(12/11 19:46:34) Dan'ni: they just take without giving anything back..
(12/11 19:46:42) Pa'lua: The do not share much of anything.
(12/11 19:46:43) Douglas Sharper: Uran District, I believe.
(12/11 19:46:48) Douglas Sharper: I don't remember.
(12/11 19:47:01) Tweek: D'ni is vast...and they know alot...but I doubt Kodama's proposal will release as much info as they have..
(12/11 19:47:02) Thanakar: they seem to have a finder's keeper's mentality
(12/11 19:47:02) Douglas Sharper: An industrial district. There has been work there.
(12/11 19:47:21) Dan'ni: Doug - did the DRC ry to contact you after you took the Journey?
(12/11 19:47:28) Tweek: I have seen photos from the industrial district
(12/11 19:47:31) Dan'ni: ah - The Industrial Complex
(12/11 19:47:32) Douglas Sharper: Even if it would, they don't listen to Kodama even. One of their own.
(12/11 19:47:41) Pa'lua: Is that the light we can see at the end of the tunnel in the courtyard?
(12/11 19:47:43) Douglas Sharper: His proposal is never talked about.
(12/11 19:47:54) Tweek: Kodama should join us
(12/11 19:48:00) Dan'ni: yes!
(12/11 19:48:02) Alkyne: hat is everyone looking at?
(12/11 19:48:09) Dan'ni: We should reach Kodama - tell him to join us!
(12/11 19:48:24) Thanakar: that woudl be interesting
(12/11 19:48:24) Tweek: Watson would be the hardest
(12/11 19:48:24) Dan'ni: we'd then show the DRC that their time is over
(12/11 19:48:32) Thanakar: convincing him to take the journey
(12/11 19:48:40) Dan'ni: I bet it's Watson who's controlling everything
(12/11 19:48:49) Tweek: the DRC doesnt need to be over...just changed
(12/11 19:48:53) LaReh: Mr. Laxman is here

(12/11 19:56:15) Brian Fioca: just curious
(12/11 19:56:27) Victor Laxman: perhaps they can fill you in
(12/11 19:56:38) Pa'lua: What possibility is that Victor?
(12/11 19:56:38) Christoph05: Well I am a greeter, I couldn't get to our hood
(12/11 19:56:40) Brian Fioca: why don't you? while your here...
(12/11 19:56:44) Brian Fioca: you're
(12/11 19:56:45) Christoph05: I would rather hear from the source
(12/11 19:56:53) Dan'ni: I see - so you think we're not worthy or important enough to twell us this in person?
(12/11 19:57:03) Jensen: do you need a link so you can get back to the nexus?
(12/11 19:57:06) Brian Fioca: you've been gone long enough to have been.... on a journey
(12/11 19:57:13) Quintin: It is our pleasure to have you with us.
(12/11 19:57:13) Brian Fioca: just a coincidence?
(12/11 19:57:43) Brian Fioca: been anywhere interesting lately :)
(12/11 19:57:56) Christoph05: Would you like a book to help you get back to wherever you need be Victor?
(12/11 19:58:09) sobeone: can victor sleep standing up?
(12/11 19:58:15) Dan'ni: lol
(12/11 19:58:25) Brian Fioca: hmmm, well, I've been places myself
(12/11 19:58:27) Victor Laxman: it's not that at all Dan'ni - it's just that it's plain to see where your interests lie
(12/11 19:58:35) Thanakar: I see his problem..no nexus book..no link book
(12/11 19:58:42) Deg: I'm just glad the ID glitch is gone.
(12/11 19:58:43) Jensen: all the Yeesha shirts?
(12/11 19:58:47) Quintin: three cheers fo Mr Laxman.
(12/11 19:58:53) Solaris cheers
(12/11 19:58:57) Christoph05 cheers
(12/11 19:58:58) Dan'ni: Victor - well we are willing to listen
(12/11 19:59:00) Victor Laxman: oh the nexus book is easily corrected - I have one hear somewhere...
(12/11 19:59:01) sobeone: sheesh, I guess I came to the wrong hood :(
(12/11 19:59:05) Dan'ni: DRC is never willing to listen to us
(12/11 19:59:05) Solaris: we will listen
(12/11 19:59:05) Thanakar: Victor, if its the restoration of D'ni, then its of interest ot an one where
(12/11 19:59:05) Brian Fioca: victor
(12/11 19:59:17) Christoph05: take mine victor
(12/11 19:59:21) Brian Fioca: why won't you tell us where you have been?
(12/11 19:59:23) Dan'ni: but we are willing to listen to both sides... whatchoice we make is our decision
(12/11 19:59:30) Brian Fioca: we're all just curious
(12/11 19:59:34) Brian Fioca: we were worried about you
(12/11 19:59:38) Solaris: please speak
(12/11 19:59:44) Victor Laxman: I've been working on an area of Ae'gura that is not yet open Mr. Fioca
(12/11 19:59:46) Thanakar: do re me fa SI LO ti do
(12/11 19:59:55) Brian Fioca: hmmm, which one?
(12/11 19:59:57) Pa'lua: Mr. Laxman, none of us are necessarily against the DRC.
(12/11 20:00:20) Eltheras: Some here are still undecided, would you risk alienating us?
(12/11 20:00:26) Brian Fioca: what phase is it in, almost done?
(12/11 20:00:42) Christoph05: I have always voiced my intrest in helping the DRC to restore areas
(12/11 20:00:42) Victor Laxman: please understand that we can tear ourselves away from these things so seldom - that when we get a chance to visit and are constantly harangued by tactless questions and veiled accusations....
(12/11 20:00:43) Tweek: Tweeks only against sales men that wake him up on his day off...grr
(12/11 20:00:55) Quintin: This is true alot of us here are not necessarily against the DRC.
(12/11 20:00:58) Brian Fioca: i didn't mean to imply anything
(12/11 20:01:04) TheEggplant: He makes a good point
(12/11 20:01:11) Victor Laxman: ah there's that book
(12/11 20:01:12) Brian Fioca: i'm sure all of us are simplly concerned with how the restoration is going
(12/11 20:01:13) Tweek: indeed
(12/11 20:01:24) LaReh: Then tell us about the Silo
(12/11 20:01:27) Thanakar: whgo is implying what? YOu implied none of us would be interested in a restoration project just by the shirt we wear
(12/11 20:01:38) Pa'lua: We are just trying to understand all that has happened.
(12/11 20:01:40) Jensen: the book is back
(12/11 20:01:44) TheEggplant: Everyone does seem to jump on everybody else.
(12/11 20:01:51) Jensen: I didn't even see it appear... haha
(12/11 20:02:00) Pa'lua: I did
(12/11 20:02:06) Tweek: Egg> yeah sorry about that didnt see you at the bottom of those stairs ;)
(12/11 20:02:16) Victor Laxman: in any case - it invovles the Great Zero
(12/11 20:02:28) LaReh: Excellent
(12/11 20:02:31) Pa'lua: Yes, Marie spoke of that the other day.
(12/11 20:02:34) Tweek: interesting
(12/11 20:02:41) Victor Laxman: I believe I've devised a way to involve interested explorers in its restorarion
(12/11 20:02:43) MrM3FaN: Sound important
(12/11 20:02:43) Thanakar: is the great zero near the arch?
(12/11 20:02:51) Dan'ni: cool! We've seen some tshots from the Great Zero - it looks great
(12/11 20:03:01) Christoph05: I have always spoken that I would like to help
(12/11 20:03:03) LaReh: You will find many volunteers I'm sure
(12/11 20:03:07) Quintin: It is at he top of the gallery, no?
(12/11 20:03:09) Tweek: The great Zero is towards the Guild Hall and up I believe
(12/11 20:03:18) Victor Laxman: it's a massive project. perhaps I can persuade the council to post some images from the site
(12/11 20:03:26) Victor Laxman: that's correct Tweek
(12/11 20:03:37) Tweek: Mr Laxman> That would be great.
(12/11 20:03:39) Thanakar: 1 point for tweek ;p
(12/11 20:03:52) Tweek: aww shucks..
(12/11 20:03:53) LaReh: We are here and willing to help
(12/11 20:03:55) Thanakar: what all woudl be invovled in its restoration?
(12/11 20:04:02) MrM3FaN: And the restoration of the Great Zero..what purpose dose it have?
(12/11 20:04:03) Victor Laxman: I've only begun to talk with the council about recruiting help and I'm here today just guaging interest in that sort of thing
(12/11 20:04:13) Victor Laxman: it's not a new Age and many are here interested only in those I'm afradi
(12/11 20:04:15) Solaris: I am interested
(12/11 20:04:23) kami: uhmmm what would begreat is if we could participate
(12/11 20:04:26) Victor Laxman: at least that's how it seems from the questions I receiev
(12/11 20:04:35) Quintin: We appreciate your candor with us on the Great Zero
(12/11 20:04:38) Tweek: Tweeks just interested in learning...as I said all along
(12/11 20:04:41) Victor Laxman: that's precisely what I'm proposing kmai
(12/11 20:04:43) Victor Laxman: kami
(12/11 20:04:44) Pa'lua: Many are interested in the restoration of D"ni.
(12/11 20:04:44) Dan'ni: I would be interested too
(12/11 20:04:45) Deg: I would be interested to help with the Restoration.
(12/11 20:04:53) Dan'ni: I'm very inteeested in getting to know both sides
(12/11 20:05:04) kami: well im in
(12/11 20:05:10) MrM3FaN: New ages is not what most seek just the opportunity for further exporation..might just be my opinion though
(12/11 20:05:12) Victor Laxman: i truly wish we did not have to speak of sides at all
(12/11 20:05:19) Cyman: I would help you sir mr Laxman
(12/11 20:05:29) Dan'ni: Well I don't like the sides stuff too
(12/11 20:05:36) Dan'ni: but it's happening and there's nothing we can do about it
(12/11 20:05:38) sobeone: I agree Victor
(12/11 20:05:39) Thanakar: True Fan...whether it be a new age, or parts of existing ages not open yet...it really doesn't matter
(12/11 20:05:40) Quintin: two /cheers for Mr Laxman
(12/11 20:05:43) Pa'lua: No, I would like to be able to work together.
(12/11 20:05:50) Tweek: I seek more history...I been studing D'ni for the last 6 years and I have bairly scratched the surface..
(12/11 20:05:54) Dan'ni: Don't get me wrong Victo - I have nothing against you or Marie or anyone from the DRC...
(12/11 20:05:58) Quintin: I agree and that is what Engberg has told us.
(12/11 20:06:00) kami: happy dance for victor
(12/11 20:06:09) Dan'ni: I just don't like the DRCs methods... DRC as an organisation
(12/11 20:06:31) sobeone: what have they done wrong?
(12/11 20:06:44) Dan'ni: perhaps I don't like the whole secrecy stuff
(12/11 20:06:44) Tweek: Dan> If I make the D'ni Jazz CLub into an organization will you dislike it to?
(12/11 20:06:50) Pa'lua: Yes, we'd just like to have more information than what has been forthcoming.
(12/11 20:06:55) Dan'ni: and contolling what we do where we go, etc.
(12/11 20:07:02) Deg: I don't see what's wrong with their "methods". They are doing the best they can.
(12/11 20:07:07) Quintin: Yes, they are just like any great establishment . They have rules, what wrong with that.
(12/11 20:07:21) Solaris: Will working on the Great Zero involve our KI's or something else?
(12/11 20:07:21) Victor Laxman: it's a fact of life - when a romantic tries and fails, he is awarded and loved - when a pragmatisit tries and succeeds he is despised
(12/11 20:07:21) TheEggplant: We need them.
(12/11 20:07:21) sobeone: what if it is all in the name of safety?
(12/11 20:07:27) TheEggplant: and they need us.
(12/11 20:07:32) Victor Laxman: It will Solaris
(12/11 20:07:33) Cyman: I guess the question is what is the DRC plans are , The DRC have invited me down and i will follow there rulz what choice do we have
(12/11 20:07:34) Deg: Danni, that's just because they are focusing on their work instead of PR of keeping 1000 of people up to date.
(12/11 20:07:47) Tweek: interesting...yes yes
(12/11 20:08:00) Dan'ni: Deg - maybe they should?
(12/11 20:08:03) LaReh: Victor> WIll the KI be improved soon?
(12/11 20:08:04) Victor Laxman: I'm sorry this discussion began so roughly
(12/11 20:08:05) Thanakar: not much choice at all Cyman as long as teh DRC controls the link books
(12/11 20:08:05) Dan'ni: at least once a week
(12/11 20:08:17) Dan'ni: post something about the restoratin - post something, reveal something
(12/11 20:08:29) Dan'ni: anything
(12/11 20:08:40) Victor Laxman: we have many improvements in mind for the KI - as to when...I'm not very good at predictions of that sort
(12/11 20:08:47) Dan'ni: so far there're only screts and silence...
(12/11 20:08:49) TheEggplant: have patience
(12/11 20:08:51) Pa'lua: Many great relationships have started roughly, Mr Laxman.
(12/11 20:08:57) Deg: I would volunteer to help the DRC with that. Some sort of link between the explorers and the DRC so info can flow easier.
(12/11 20:09:20) Solaris: What kind of improvements?
(12/11 20:09:22) Callista: aeh.. hi
(12/11 20:09:23) Callista: aeh.. hi
(12/11 20:09:25) Callista: aeh.. hi
(12/11 20:09:26) Tweek: Pa'lua> thats true..me and my pet cactus started out badly...he kept stinging me everytime I hugged him...
(12/11 20:09:29) Deg: Danni, but shouldnt restoration be more infortant than information
(12/11 20:09:29) Callista: aeh.. hi
(12/11 20:09:30) Thanakar: will we able to finally use KI mail?
(12/11 20:09:32) Dan'ni: I am also willing to help the DRC... simple reason - seeing how they work from the inside will allow me to learn more about wh they really are
(12/11 20:09:37) Callista: aeh.. hi
(12/11 20:09:44) Dan'ni: Deg - I think both should be balanced
(12/11 20:09:46) Jensen yawns
(12/11 20:09:50) Dan'ni: one cannot exist without the other
(12/11 20:10:06) Victor Laxman: mostly suggestions from explorers like yourselves - things to make chatting easier
(12/11 20:10:16) Pa'lua: The point is that each party in the relationship has to put forth effort to make it work.
(12/11 20:10:28) Callista: what are u doing here?
(12/11 20:10:29) Callista: what are u doing here?
(12/11 20:10:31) Callista: what are u doing here?
(12/11 20:10:35) Callista: what are u doing here?
(12/11 20:10:38) Solaris: How is that tied in with the Great Zero?
(12/11 20:10:43) Callista: what are u doing here?
(12/11 20:10:44) Solaris: or is it?
(12/11 20:10:47) Dan'ni: Pa'lua is right - you cannot expect us tobe with th DRC if the DRC doesn't open itself to us
(12/11 20:10:47) Cyman: Chatting with Mr Laxman Callista
(12/11 20:10:50) Pa'lua: I can't not be a one-sided relationship.
(12/11 20:10:53) Victor Laxman: Callista seems to have a malfunction
(12/11 20:10:57) Tweek: A DRC bulletin should be passed around waring all of my sense of humor...people have taken offense to it...
(12/11 20:11:15) Tweek: Mr Laxman> yes thats been happening a lot recently
(12/11 20:11:21) sobeone: Out of curiosity, did the DRC ever test some of the suits that were found in Gahreson (sp?) ?
(12/11 20:11:34) Quintin: Yes that happens often, Mr. Laxman.
(12/11 20:11:42) LaReh: Over-cautiousness breeds suspicion, honesty is always the best policy
(12/11 20:11:46) Victor Laxman: it's interesting you ask that sobeone
(12/11 20:12:02) Victor Laxman: that might can be arranged Tweek
(12/11 20:12:10) Victor Laxman: we have many exciting things coming
(12/11 20:12:19) Tweek: lovely
(12/11 20:12:36) sobeone: what were the benifits of the suit?
(12/11 20:12:45) Victor Laxman: your patience is critical at this time...I wish I could say more - I know our silence doesn't help our position
(12/11 20:13:05) sobeone: I know you dont want to get our hopes up :)
(12/11 20:13:13) Solaris: Will the Great Zero pinpoint the exaxt location of someone so we can link to them somehow?
(12/11 20:13:16) Thanakar: yes..the silence is had to bear at times
(12/11 20:13:22) Tweek: I think just the old word to the explorers would help alot Mr Laxman
(12/11 20:13:32) Pa'lua: The lack of information is difficult to deal with.
(12/11 20:13:45) kami: might there be a little something more victor......
(12/11 20:13:51) Victor Laxman: the Great Zero is critical in all the city's technologies that utilize coordinate systems
(12/11 20:13:54) Tweek: *odd even
(12/11 20:14:01) Dan'ni: how big is The Great Zero?
(12/11 20:14:07) Victor Laxman: we won't know everything it effects I'm afraid until we ...turn it on
(12/11 20:14:07) Cyman: LIke a tracking devise of some sort
(12/11 20:14:09) Thanakar: critical to teh link books themselves tehn?
(12/11 20:14:10) Dan'ni: it looks huge from what I have seen so far
(12/11 20:14:14) Victor Laxman: with all of your help I hope
(12/11 20:14:32) Pa'lua: We will help if we can.
(12/11 20:14:38) kami: yes ......when can we help
(12/11 20:14:41) Eltheras: How do we begin?
(12/11 20:14:42) LaReh: We are always willing to help
(12/11 20:14:43) Dan'ni: If oyu let us help...
(12/11 20:14:44) Christoph05: Here, here
(12/11 20:14:52) Dan'ni: If you only let us help....
(12/11 20:14:54) Tweek: Dan> I dont dunno how you could size up the Great Zero...I know its a temple on top of Ae'gura apparently
(12/11 20:14:57) Cyman cheers
(12/11 20:15:05) Thanakar: and if it doesn't require me to change shirts...
(12/11 20:15:08) Deg: Victor, How can we help? What specific things can we do to assist the DRC?
(12/11 20:15:10) Victor Laxman: we begin by me convincing the council to let me enlist your help
(12/11 20:15:15) Tweek: Well I'd be happy to help in any way I can Mr Laxman
(12/11 20:15:36) kami: politics eh?
(12/11 20:15:43) Eltheras: Is there any chance we may sit in on a council meeting in the future?
(12/11 20:15:53) Pa'lua: How difficult do you feel this will be Mr. Laxman?
(12/11 20:15:56) Victor Laxman: If you see other council members, express to them your willingness to assist
(12/11 20:16:12) Dan'ni: I only hope they will listen
(12/11 20:16:16) Christoph05: I feel when I have, it has fallen upon deaf ears victor
(12/11 20:16:16) MrM3FaN: Sounds good to me
(12/11 20:16:26) Tweek: I have only seen yourself Mr Engberg and Dr Sutherland since I first came down here
(12/11 20:16:29) Thanakar: would they be willing to listen to us more if we weren't wearing the shirt?
(12/11 20:16:46) Dan'ni: Thanakar> being with Yeesha doesn't mean being against the DRC
(12/11 20:16:55) Victor Laxman: well, the shirt can be a barrier to some
(12/11 20:17:04) MrM3FaN: Yes are we just being casted aside because of the shirt we wear?
(12/11 20:17:06) Christoph05: It is a shirt, and nothing more
(12/11 20:17:06) Pa'lua: No, and the DRC need to realize this.
(12/11 20:17:07) kami: oh geeeezzzzz i gotta change again
(12/11 20:17:16) Dan'ni: well then perhaps the DRc should take the Journey too to understand why so many war the shirts?
(12/11 20:17:21) Thanakar: To some it IS a barrier Tweek
(12/11 20:17:23) Deg: Not of the shirt, but of what it represents
(12/11 20:17:30) Tweek: Well with the typical english weather we've been having apparently I should really wear a coat
(12/11 20:17:32) Dan'ni: because how can you restore D'ni if you don't know everything?
(12/11 20:17:40) Victor Laxman: not castes aside MrM3
(12/11 20:17:43) Christoph05: The shirt is a gift, that is why I will choose to wear it
(12/11 20:17:58) Thanakar: Victor is here Snert
(12/11 20:18:31) Cyman: I have not seen the docks
(12/11 20:18:33) Tweek: Airship? hmm interesting
(12/11 20:18:42) LaReh: Don't judge a book bu it's cover
(12/11 20:18:53) Tweek: I have a dock in my RElto...I have a link to it if you want it Cyman
(12/11 20:19:01) Victor Laxman: I honestly am not certain why a philosophy is dividing the explorers so - but again, I'm an engineer through and through - I'm much more at home with my projects - and any who are interested in those sorts of things I will endeavor to include
(12/11 20:19:19) Thanakar: Jenu...we all hear you
(12/11 20:19:31) Dan'ni: well I am an IT student so I love all the IT stuff...
(12/11 20:19:41) Dan'ni: and the technological things
(12/11 20:19:47) Cyman waves
(12/11 20:19:50) Thanakar: Victor..will you allow us to help you adn allow us to wear our gift?
(12/11 20:19:54) Dan'ni: that is..when I'm on the surface...
(12/11 20:20:13) Pa'lua: No, just as we should not judge someone for the color of their skin, we should not judge by the clothing we wear.
(12/11 20:20:25) Dan'ni: bingo Pa'lua!
(12/11 20:20:25) Deg: Victor, please do yourbest to convience the Council that we can help.
(12/11 20:20:29) Dan'ni claps his hands
(12/11 20:20:35) LaReh: Well said Paula
(12/11 20:20:37) Deg: but the tshirt represents an idea
(12/11 20:20:40) LaReh claps his hands
(12/11 20:20:42) kami: thank you paula
(12/11 20:20:45) Deg: they are judge against the idea, not the shirt
(12/11 20:20:47) Victor Laxman: of course Thanakar, but it does make the political aspects of my job harder
(12/11 20:20:49) sobeone: except you can change your shirt :)
(12/11 20:20:49) Snerticus: t-shirt?
(12/11 20:21:12) Dan'ni: there're so many people here... from different cultures sociaties... and they all work togther
(12/11 20:21:12) Thanakar: I think you should take the journey we took..its very enlightening
