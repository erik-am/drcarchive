(12/19 19:01:17) From Dr Watson in Kirel Neighborhood: Hello Tink? May I call you that?
(12/19 19:01:46) To Dr Watson: sure . . .can we talk?
(12/19 19:02:11) From Dr Watson in Kirel Neighborhood: Are you available? Actually I have an odd request.
(12/19 19:02:49) To Dr Watson: sure . . what do you need?
(12/19 19:03:49) From Dr Watson in Kirel Neighborhood: Well... we've asked Phil about anyone he might know or trust...
(12/19 19:03:59) From Dr Watson in Kirel Neighborhood: ...and he mentioned you.
(12/19 19:04:13) From Dr Watson in Kirel Neighborhood: Would you be available to chat with him briefly?
(12/19 19:04:29) To Dr Watson: sure . . .I asked about him a few minutes ago
(12/19 19:04:56) From Dr Watson in Kirel Neighborhood: It would reassure people about his wellbeing.
(12/19 19:05:23) From Dr Watson in Kirel Neighborhood: I'll send you an invitation to a neighborhood the DRC uses.
(12/19 19:05:59) From Dr Watson in Kirel Neighborhood: Thank you. See you soon.

(12/19 19:15:08) Tink: Straight answer would help, doctor
(12/19 19:15:15) Dr Watson: We're not keeping him.
(12/19 19:15:24) Dr Watson: We just want to make sure he's alright.
(12/19 19:15:34) Tink: He thinks so . . . and from the look of it . . . so do I

(12/19 19:24:54) Tink: What has been worrying you about phil?
(12/19 19:25:17) Tink: He seems as loopy as ole Tink . . . not particularly goofy clinically
(12/19 19:25:40) Dr Watson: He's a friend who's been gone for a year - and he's returned...not quite himself
(12/19 19:25:51) Tink: How is he different?
(12/19 19:26:30) Dr Watson: he always had a special concern for...the D'ni - but not as you see him now
(12/19 19:26:43) Dr Watson: and like you said - there's something just not quite right
(12/19 19:26:57) Tink: The D'ni . . . I have VERY mixed feelings about them . . .
(12/19 19:27:03) Tink: how did he feel about them?
(12/19 19:27:08) Dr Watson: I'm concerned at two levels - personally...for my friend and colleague
(12/19 19:27:21) Dr Watson: and professionally for the sake of the restoration
(12/19 19:27:31) Tink: I didn't say there was something different . . you did, sir
(12/19 19:27:33) Dr Watson: I'd love to discuss this more but we do really need to get going
(12/19 19:27:45) Tink: Can we talk again sometime?
(12/19 19:27:54) Dr Watson: Thank you for your time Tink and understanding
(12/19 19:28:15) Tink: Talk again to me sometime . . .

(12/19 19:29:14) Dr Watson: Tink please pass on the truth to those who are worried
(12/19 19:29:17) Tink: Dr Watson . . . can I pass this on to others?
(12/19 19:29:31) Tink: OK . . . thought I needed to ask
