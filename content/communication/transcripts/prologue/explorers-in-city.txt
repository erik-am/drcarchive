(11/19 00:33:13) Dusante: yeah that disappearing act was, a little freaky
(11/19 00:33:19) Garvin: have a drink, Mr Engberg?
(11/19 00:33:31) Michael Engberg: enjoy this for now.. and the DRC will have to have a meeting to see if really want it open..
(11/19 00:33:42) Archais: So were do you get teh greeter shirts?
(11/19 00:33:54) Michael Engberg: i don't drink..
(11/19 00:34:01) Dalamith: soda?
(11/19 00:34:10) UbiqriD'NIculous: that's good, because we have no drinks
(11/19 00:34:10) Daniel: Mix me up a Geotherm Gin. On the rocks
(11/19 00:34:20) UbiqriD'NIculous: well, you know that

(11/19 00:34:29) Dalamith: here you go
(11/19 00:34:33) Garvin: Then give us purpose, Mr. Engberg
(11/19 00:34:36) Zardoz: I was mixing the drink
(11/19 00:34:46) UbiqriD'NIculous: the jumping seems a touch unsafe to me, more than the drinking
(11/19 00:34:49) Archais: I couldn't get the drink ... apparently its too heavy
(11/19 00:34:50) Michael Engberg: So.. all I ask is becarefull ok
(11/19 00:34:59) Archais: I should stick to feathers
(11/19 00:35:01) Michael Engberg: any other questions?
(11/19 00:35:01) Daniel: You've got it Mr. Engberg
(11/19 00:35:06) Archais: but there are no feathers
(11/19 00:35:08) UbiqriD'NIculous: are there any first aid kits in the city, mr. engberg?
(11/19 00:35:13) Daniel: There were qquestions? I didn't hear down.gif
(11/19 00:35:15) Dalamith: no problem. i don't think abunch of drunk explorers can do too much harm
(11/19 00:35:18) Dalamith: just kidding
(11/19 00:35:22) Archais: cool your back
(11/19 00:35:32) Christoph05: Where can I find a bed, i'd like to take a nap before going back to the surface.
(11/19 00:35:33) Michael Engberg: no.. only on the surface..
(11/19 00:35:39) UbiqriD'NIculous: in case of accidents, i mean
(11/19 00:35:47) UbiqriD'NIculous: OK, may I bring some down?
(11/19 00:35:47) Michael Engberg: nap in the neighborhood..
(11/19 00:36:01) Christoph05: ok, sleep in the fountain and get pneumonia right?
(11/19 00:36:04) Dusante: gee, thats pretty far to go, especially if you have a serious injury
(11/19 00:36:12) Michael Engberg: Ubi.. follow the DRC and there won't be any..
(11/19 00:36:13) Dalamith: nah, there's no water in the fountain yet
(11/19 00:36:13) UbiqriD'NIculous: it seems a bit odd to leave such things on the surface
(11/19 00:36:15) Blue Max: Well, the waters' still turned off...
(11/19 00:36:15) Dusante: i should get one for my relto
(11/19 00:36:21) Archais: So who is the Dn'i that was referred to in the letter on the Baron's City Office Desk??
(11/19 00:36:27) UbiqriD'NIculous: well, you do look quite healthy
(11/19 00:36:30) Daniel: I keep some stuff at my relto. Man. There was this lava incident once..I won't get into it
(11/19 00:36:30) UbiqriD'NIculous: :)
(11/19 00:36:38) Archais: Has the DRC seen him/her around?
(11/19 00:36:39) Michael Engberg: what letter?
(11/19 00:36:54) UbiqriD'NIculous: I've seen some barefoot people near the ferry, that's what made me concerned
(11/19 00:37:11) Archais: There is a letter on the Baron's Desk that talks about the DRC meeting a Dn'i that survived
(11/19 00:37:15) Michael Engberg: I don't go reading other peoples stuff
(11/19 00:37:27) Michael Engberg: so I don't know..
(11/19 00:37:28) Daniel: ::whistles innocently::
(11/19 00:37:40) Christoph05: Is it possible that Douglas Sharper will come visit us soon?
(11/19 00:37:56) UbiqriD'NIculous: yeah, isn't he supposed to be fixing this place up, Michael?
(11/19 00:38:19) Michael Engberg: chris.. maybe.. I'll see if i can talk to nick about talking to him..

(11/19 00:38:36) Zardoz waves
(11/19 00:38:42) Michael Engberg: Ubi.. another reason to close it..
(11/19 00:39:01) Christoph05: Is he that wreckless??
(11/19 00:39:03) Archais: So when do you think the rest of the city will be open
(11/19 00:39:10) Michael Engberg: Did you guys know Nick visited the DRC 1 today..
(11/19 00:39:20) Dusante: yeah i saw nick for a bit

(11/19 00:39:31) Christoph05: I was on the surface all day. Missed him
(11/19 00:39:44) Daniel: Rand was..very Zoned Out
(11/19 00:40:00) Archais: Cool when was Rand down here?
(11/19 00:40:02) Michael Engberg: I heard Kodama had a conversation with someone too..
(11/19 00:40:03) Dalamith: man i had to be on the surface all day. i wish i could have met them
(11/19 00:40:18) Daniel: Oh yeah. I think i remember Kodama as well.
(11/19 00:40:32) Michael Engberg: lets say Kodama can be harsh...
(11/19 00:40:36) Archais: I tried to meet with him the other time he was here but traffic was to bad
(11/19 00:40:39) UbiqriD'NIculous: is there any security down here, other than the Council members?
(11/19 00:40:57) Michael Engberg: bi.. not yet
(11/19 00:41:07) Dusante: what did kod say?
(11/19 00:41:08) Michael Engberg: ubi
(11/19 00:41:14) UbiqriD'NIculous: so there will be?
(11/19 00:41:22) Archais: So is the DRC working on fixing one of the boats?
(11/19 00:41:37) Christoph05: How do the barriers manage to keep us from going over them?? Some kind of D'Ni magic?
(11/19 00:41:38) Michael Engberg: Who knows about if there will be..
(11/19 00:41:41) Blue Max: Fixing? Those heaps need a drydock...
(11/19 00:41:48) UbiqriD'NIculous: :)
(11/19 00:41:58) UbiqriD'NIculous: that's what I'm trying to find out, Mike
(11/19 00:42:12) Michael Engberg: boats.. another thing we might someday get too..
(11/19 00:42:19) Archais: cool
(11/19 00:42:20) Dusante: nice
(11/19 00:42:34) Michael Engberg: someday.. might be another 5 years...
(11/19 00:42:42) Blue Max: If you want a boat it'd be a lot faster and more efficient to hoist down a couple of Zodiacs and jerrycans of gas
(11/19 00:42:42) Michael Engberg: :)
(11/19 00:42:46) Archais: oh ... not so cool .. heh
(11/19 00:42:53) UbiqriD'NIculous: Might I reccomend kickboards for the interim?
(11/19 00:42:54) Christoph05: Is that D'ni years or surface years?
(11/19 00:42:59) Garvin: 5 years!?
(11/19 00:43:12) UbiqriD'NIculous: recommend, that is
(11/19 00:43:17) Daniel: Gah. kickboards. Sytrofoam Doom
