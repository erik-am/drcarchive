(12/04 19:41:15) Quintin: it is the grand meeting place

(12/04 19:42:00) Michael Engberg: Just to let you know I wasn't even planning for a meeting tonight, so I might be short
(12/04 19:42:12) Quintin: Say your peace. come on
(12/04 19:42:25) Quintin: Are you for or against the DRC or the third side

(12/04 19:42:41) Tweek: Hey Quintin, can you open the linking room door?
(12/04 19:42:46) Arnium: Shorah Tweek, Tink
(12/04 19:42:56) Tweek: hi Tink
(12/04 19:42:57) Christoph05: I am mainly on the neutral side, however I would like to help the DRC if they change some things
(12/04 19:43:01) Tink: Hiya Arnium!
(12/04 19:43:02) Quintin: I cannot open the door, let me try later please. or
(12/04 19:43:02) From Strife in D'ni-Ae'gura: find him?
(12/04 19:43:16) To Strife: Quintin's
(12/04 19:43:18) Quintin: Michael what do yo have to say to that...
(12/04 19:43:24) Ford Prefect: the other side is open
(12/04 19:43:44) Michael Engberg: sides.. everyone is talking about sides down here..
(12/04 19:43:58) Ford Prefect starts to laugh
(12/04 19:43:59) Quintin: I am giving Micheal a chance
(12/04 19:44:10) Michael Engberg: Let me place the nexus book and then I'll start the meeting
(12/04 19:44:16) Quintin: Come on Micheal, I am sorry that the meeting attendance is out of control
(12/04 19:44:19) Ford Prefect: i meant the otehr door
(12/04 19:44:22) Taliametris: Everyone has been told that they must choose sides so naturally they talk about it
(12/04 19:44:28) bonz: this is d`ni how do we all work togather
(12/04 19:44:28) Tweek: Im gonna take the side of soem random lamp..we alone will light the cavern bwuhahah...erm or not
(12/04 19:44:53) Taliametris: I'm sorry I do not understand what you mean
(12/04 19:45:04) Taliametris: I arrived late
(12/04 19:45:27) Ford Prefect: do you stand at a 45 degree angle often?
(12/04 19:45:57) Tink: Saw the Nexus book come into the room
(12/04 19:46:26) Michael Engberg: Tink I placed it there..
(12/04 19:46:28) Quintin: Ok I would like to name names as to who is stirring up trouble.
(12/04 19:46:38) Michael Engberg: OKay lets sit
(12/04 19:46:48) Tweek: I should see about playing more heek later
(12/04 19:46:49) From Quintin: Tink please please be cool
(12/04 19:46:55) Elion: how do i sit?
(12/04 19:46:57) Michael Engberg: First off how is everyone doing?
(12/04 19:47:04) Rodnik: excellent sir
(12/04 19:47:08) Quintin: good
(12/04 19:47:15) Arnium: Talia is having communication problems
(12/04 19:47:18) Lindy: great
(12/04 19:47:20) Quintin: lets  all greet the guest
(12/04 19:47:24) Michael Engberg: no need to call me sir, I'm michael
(12/04 19:47:35) To Quintin: lips are sealed
(12/04 19:47:42) Rodnik: sorry i call alot of people sir for no reason
(12/04 19:47:56) From Quintin: Thankyou very much, that will be appreciated
(12/04 19:47:58) Elion: how do i sit down?
(12/04 19:48:19) Michael Engberg: I've heard rumors about divisions, on the DRC site and down here.
(12/04 19:48:31) Michael Engberg: It worries me,
(12/04 19:48:35) Ford Prefect: ive heard rumors about the green lights
(12/04 19:48:39) Rodnik: i think its silly
(12/04 19:48:44) Tweek: green lights?
(12/04 19:48:48) Michael Engberg: Green lights?
(12/04 19:49:15) Ford Prefect: the green lights here having an effect on something
(12/04 19:49:35) Michael Engberg: again I wasn't really planning a "DRC" Meeting, just kind of want to hear your concerns
(12/04 19:49:49) Taliametris: People have been encouraged to think that they must choose sides, and therefore it is the course of much talk
(12/04 19:50:07) Michael Engberg: the divisions , sides, what ever you would like to call them does worry me
(12/04 19:50:11) Taliametris: and that leads naturally to people taking u p positions
(12/04 19:50:22) To LaReh: Engberg's in Quintin's Neighborhood . . . and he's talking
(12/04 19:50:33) Rodnik: i think the majority of people really would like to keep the issue of sides out of it
(12/04 19:50:40) Taliametris: And that has led to some division
(12/04 19:50:41) From LaReh in The URU Obsession (39) Neighborhood: KI please
(12/04 19:50:43) Rodnik: there are those that wish to force opinions
(12/04 19:50:45) Taliametris: Yes - I agree
(12/04 19:50:56) To LaReh: Mine/ Michaels?
(12/04 19:51:01) Michael Engberg:  like I have said before we are all family down here
(12/04 19:51:05) From LaReh in The URU Obsession (39) Neighborhood: yours!
(12/04 19:51:07) Tweek: the sides choosing thing is annoying me...people are being sneaky trying to get otthers in trouble..and being rude and impatient..
(12/04 19:51:23) Michael Engberg: and even in family you will have people who disagree
...
(12/04 19:51:38) To LaReh: mine=338648
(12/04 19:51:39) Taliametris: it is about power
(12/04 19:51:44) Tweek: Dont think many people realise that to make this restoration work we must get along
(12/04 19:52:04) bonz: michael did i realy see you walk over to the fountian and turn on the water??
(12/04 19:52:13) From LaReh in The URU Obsession (39) Neighborhood: thankies
(12/04 19:52:18) bonz: when i first got here
(12/04 19:52:36) Michael Engberg: Tweek, exactly, I think if we agree that we can
disagree . Life will go alot easier
(12/04 19:52:41) Taliametris: the anti-DRC faction want power over the explorers
(12/04 19:52:54) John_Drake: Michale, you could difuse the Sharper situation. After all he was only following the DRC's guidlines by getting rid of a dangerious creature. There have been unconfirmed reports of Shroomie attacks on explorers
(12/04 19:52:57) Taliametris: to use against the DRC
(12/04 19:53:16) Tweek: John> yes the shroomie thing has gotten way out of hand
(12/04 19:53:25) Michael Engberg: talia, I hate jumping tte assuming
(12/04 19:53:28) Taliametris: I do not want to take sides, they seem equally unknown
(12/04 19:53:38) Michael Engberg: what I mean is I hate to assume
(12/04 19:54:07) louis.cyphre gÃ¤hnt
(12/04 19:54:15) Taliametris: It is an ongoing process that is damaging
(12/04 19:54:19) Tweek: Rodnik> Oh some of them have trust me
(12/04 19:54:24) Michael Engberg: Bonz, yes I turned on the water. Talked to some of THe DRC boys via KI and they turned it on.
(12/04 19:54:49) Tweek: when back on the surface I have read some of the views of others and its obvious they have choosen
(12/04 19:55:08) John_Drake: If you find the time Michael, the water in the Village is still off too
(12/04 19:55:40) Taliametris: Not all of them are quiet
(12/04 19:55:45) Michael Engberg:  so basicly, all i have to say lets all get along..
(12/04 19:55:52) Tweek: agreed Talia
(12/04 19:55:57) Ford Prefect: also, the island pages are missing all over, but there may be a reason for thta
(12/04 19:56:00) Arnium: Let's keep on topic folks.
(12/04 19:56:03) bonz: i think th as explores we need to stay togather and not let them take away the ouly power we have
(12/04 19:56:11) Tweek: well I for one agree with those sentiments Michael
(12/04 19:56:13) John_Drake: We are, most of us, trying
(12/04 19:56:15) Taliametris: I agree with that
(12/04 19:57:00) Michael Engberg: I know people are not always going to agree with the DRC, but if you get to know us and understand us better I think you will see we are not that bad.
(12/04 19:57:49) Tweek: I admit I do find you sometimes over cautious..if I spelt that correctly..but I can see why you do put such a meaning on safty down here..its very dangerous
(12/04 19:58:29) Arnium: Enlighten us then, what are your goals/plans for the exploration of D'ni. In general terms?
(12/04 19:58:31) Tweek: but I do feel that people need to be patient..demanding that area to be opened is only going to cause accidents
(12/04 19:59:15) Michael Engberg: Tweek,  yes, we have been , but then look at our past. Fight Branch, phil going somewhere we had no clue of where. There are unknown dangers all around us.
(12/04 19:59:26) Tweek: yes
(12/04 19:59:37) Tweek: what happened to Branch?
(12/04 19:59:45) Taliametris: Why is he so reluctant to talk to you?
(12/04 19:59:50) John_Drake: I agree, there are no first aid kits that I have seen
(12/04 19:59:52) Tweek: we have been lucky that Phil is...erm ok
(12/04 19:59:53) Taliametris: I mean Phil Henderson
(12/04 20:00:15) Michael Engberg: I wish I knew..
(12/04 20:00:21) Tweek: Talia> Phil has things he needs to do..like some of us..he'll speak when he feels it is time
(12/04 20:00:38) Ford Prefect: I know that theres not much that can be done about it now, but I think the "sides" kinda stemed from when Yesha told us to "wear our shirts to show what side we had taken, when sides are taken"
(12/04 20:00:58) Tweek: yes, silly lady hehe
(12/04 20:00:58) Michael Engberg: Everyone wants to know the "Plan"
(12/04 20:01:15) Arnium: The present "choice" does not seem to include Yeesha?
(12/04 20:01:34) Taliametris: No - we should have a say.  The plan should be One which is inclusive of the explorers
(12/04 20:01:36) Tweek: Ah come come Michael thats a genralization..not everyone whats to know the plan
(12/04 20:02:01) John_Drake: But some hints would be nice
(12/04 20:02:02) Michael Engberg: The plan is to continue to work like the DRC has always needed to.
(12/04 20:02:15) Tweek: Talia> true..but it is still early days yet
(12/04 20:02:23) To Michael Engberg: Can I post the chatlog . . . on Greeter's Guild forum?
(12/04 20:02:25) Michael Engberg: I have been in Er'cana ..
(12/04 20:02:35) louis.cyphre beginnt zu laut lachen
(12/04 20:02:38) Michael Engberg: tink yes..
(12/04 20:02:57) Taliametris: If there was more open ness on all sides it would be less easy for people to divide us
(12/04 20:03:04) Tweek: true
(12/04 20:03:15) Michael Engberg: Dr. Laxman has been working so so had, and infact might need your help sometime.
(12/04 20:03:15) To Quintin: just asked if I could post the chatlog, Quintin
(12/04 20:03:32) John_Drake: Glad to help
(12/04 20:03:48) Tweek: I think out of all the "sides" Ive spoken to Phil has been the most forthcoming..DRC next..
(12/04 20:03:58) Tweek: I have yet to meet Laxman.
(12/04 20:04:04) Michael Engberg: opps I mean  Mr. 
(12/04 20:04:35) Michael Engberg: He's more of a doctor in the meaning of life. :)
(12/04 20:04:50) Taliametris: I think that the people here are the best thing about the Cavern...and we shoudl fight hard to conserve what we have
(12/04 20:04:59) Taliametris: while fighting for the chance to be involved in the
exploration
(12/04 20:05:19) Michael Engberg: So here is a question to you all, how does the DRC be more open?
(12/04 20:05:20) Taliametris: and to be involved - I do not like secrecy and lack of openness
(12/04 20:05:25) Taliametris: all is promises about the future
(12/04 20:06:01) Taliametris: Things happen and are not explained
(12/04 20:06:13) Taliametris: thus rumours start
(12/04 20:06:24) Ford Prefect: maybe put messages on the imager as to what type of progress is being made in opening a new age/area
(12/04 20:06:26) Taliametris: green lights - good example
(12/04 20:06:29) John_Drake: one at a time now, not all at once
(12/04 20:06:38) Rodnik: like why the pub at the ferry was closed down suddenly
(12/04 20:06:38) Michael Engberg:  Things like what Talia?
(12/04 20:06:46) Taliametris: loss of nexus links today...maybe a bug...maybe not
(12/04 20:07:01) Taliametris: the loss of relto pages
(12/04 20:07:06) Taliametris: vanishing bahro stones
(12/04 20:07:15) Taliametris: areas closed off that were open
(12/04 20:07:23) Michael Engberg: Talia, nexus links has a KI message.
(12/04 20:07:24) Taliametris: there are many questions
(12/04 20:07:29) Taliametris: and few answers
(12/04 20:07:35) Arnium: I am not so sure that the DRC has control over all of these things?
(12/04 20:07:43) Tweek: having KI issues
(12/04 20:07:51) LaReh: Some DRC have been almost condescending to explorers, that doesn't help your cause
(12/04 20:07:53) Tweek: there we go
(12/04 20:07:55) Taliametris: Perhaps not - but it is hard to discern much information in the audiences we have been granted
(12/04 20:08:00) John_Drake: When a people get used to somthing and that something is taken away that tends to get them upset
(12/04 20:08:25) Arnium: I thought we were talking about stopping the division, not about how everything here is not working properly!
(12/04 20:08:51) Tweek: Michael> how goes Dr Kodama's proposal?
(12/04 20:08:54) Michael Engberg: Talk to Dr. K about more info, he wants to release it all. I am in the middle ground.
(12/04 20:09:13) Taliametris: It is all part of the same thing which allows people to discuss things without real basis for their discussion
(12/04 20:09:22) Rodnik: the reason there is a devision or one of them is because the drc doesnt explain itself as much as they could/should, we are explaining how the drc could be more open
(12/04 20:09:37) Ford Prefect: could people please shout? we are not hearing everyone
(12/04 20:09:38) Tweek: to much info too soon can be difficult..if you are to release information its sometimes best to release it in stages
(12/04 20:10:06) Michael Engberg:  exactly tweek
(12/04 20:10:07) Taliametris: I do not want to have to choose sides, if that is part of the plan, I do not want it
(12/04 20:10:53) Michael Engberg: Talia, I don't want you to choose sides  either. I want everyone to be a family, one big family
(12/04 20:11:11) Taliametris: That is how it has been
(12/04 20:11:21) Taliametris: But things seem to be changing
(12/04 20:11:26) Arnium: Daddy! Can I have the keys to the library?
(12/04 20:11:31) Tweek: lol
(12/04 20:11:33) LaReh: LOL
(12/04 20:11:43) John_Drake: hahahaah
(12/04 20:11:55) Michael Engberg: So, here is the problem, some areas are just not ready.
(12/04 20:12:25) Tweek: Talia> Change happens...whether good or bad it happens..the thing is we know change is comming so its up to us to shape it into how things should be
(12/04 20:12:32) Michael Engberg: Bonz, island page?
(12/04 20:12:38) Taliametris: That is what I am trying to do
(12/04 20:12:53) Deg: What are the terms to clasify an area as ready?  Aren't explorers smart enough to explore carefully?
(12/04 20:13:01) Taliametris: Tweek unless we stand up for unity among the explorers, it will be changed too
(12/04 20:13:03) Michael Engberg:  So here is an example,
(12/04 20:13:04) Tweek: Bonz> you may wanna speak to Henderson about that
(12/04 20:13:14) Tweek: Talia> Yes I agree with that
(12/04 20:13:36) Arnium: Micheal, does the DRC feel that we are not qualified enough to be explores?
(12/04 20:13:55) Michael Engberg: yesterday we opened the courtyard, we gave you a few days notice. People waited ..
(12/04 20:14:03) Tweek: Im not qualificated...Im only an Artist and webmast ^_^
(12/04 20:14:09) Tweek: *master
(12/04 20:14:31) Tweek: yes its nice to beable to get back up to the courtyard
(12/04 20:14:36) Michael Engberg: As soon as we opened the area, some people went and jumped on top of the tent.
(12/04 20:14:47) Deg: Yes, Tweek.  But you also have common sense not to get over your head.  Explorers should be able to judge weither areas are safe or not.
(12/04 20:15:07) Arnium: Thank you Micael, I believe you have answered my question.
(12/04 20:15:16) Strife: has the drc had any complaints from people falling off the tent?
(12/04 20:15:29) Ford Prefect: who would do such a thing? *cough*
(12/04 20:15:29) Deg: Hmm...  That is unfortunate.  You would think the people that are "called to D'ni" would be smarter than to jump on tents.
(12/04 20:15:44) Tweek: Deg> perhaps..but are explorers structual engineers? can they see what cracks in buildings can prove to be a hazard under the weight of 30 odd people?
(12/04 20:15:52) Strife: good point tweek
(12/04 20:16:09) Michael Engberg: Arnium, here is my question to you. Do you feel all explorers are qualified?
(12/04 20:16:49) Arnium: ?shout I am not sure about my qualifications, only about my "callin".
(12/04 20:16:54) Strife: the real issue is that the drc doesn't want leet explorers, or explorers with special access
(12/04 20:16:55) Daedalus: who's to say who is "qualified," exactly, Michael? Can anyone really have that kind of say?
(12/04 20:17:02) Christoph05: I feel that the qualified will help the underqualified if there are any under.
(12/04 20:17:05) Arnium: Calling sorry
(12/04 20:17:11) Michael Engberg: I think everyone here has the potential to be someone great. I hope we all try our hardest at it.
(12/04 20:17:34) Michael Engberg: I think you all make fine explorers
(12/04 20:17:35) Tweek: yes..Tweek Ruler of D'ni has a great ring to it...
(12/04 20:17:43) Tweek: woops did I just let that slip
(12/04 20:17:46) Beefo laRue: The problem I see is that the DRC dictates all action it's a dictatorship. What say do the explorers have, in the shaping of the new D'ni?
(12/04 20:17:49) LaReh: :-P
(12/04 20:17:52) Taliametris: That has been characteristic so far - that the more
experienced have helped the less experienced
(12/04 20:18:01) Taliametris: as a group we are qualified
(12/04 20:18:12) Michael Engberg: Beefo, we will need your help
(12/04 20:18:14) Deg: Perhaps if more explorers could assist in the restoration, we'd have less time on our hands to jump on tents.
(12/04 20:18:15) Taliametris: No Yeesha let us
(12/04 20:18:18) Arnium: We assume that the DRC is the true power here?
(12/04 20:18:20) Taliametris: not the DRC?
(12/04 20:18:47) Daedalus: Who can really say who is "qualified", Michael? Can anyone really have that kind of say?
(12/04 20:18:52) Tweek: there is no true power...
(12/04 20:18:59) Beefo laRue: thats perhaps a harsh term. I don't mean to confir the negotive conotations
(12/04 20:19:04) Tweek: unless one believes in the maker
(12/04 20:19:05) Strife: I have been wondering what help could the explorers give to the rebuilding of dni?
(12/04 20:19:10) Michael Engberg: Everyone... listen please. To shape D'ni the drc can not do it alone. We will need your help
(12/04 20:19:24) Deg: just not yet?
(12/04 20:19:30) Beefo laRue: agreed the question is how
(12/04 20:19:38) Daedalus: agreed.
(12/04 20:19:44) Daedalus: how?
(12/04 20:19:59) Michael Engberg:  Yep, just not yet..  We are getting things in place, making the Ki work.
(12/04 20:20:12) Arnium: Michael, we do not want to help you, we want to join you.
(12/04 20:20:12) Christoph05: a Willing and Volunteer workforce
(12/04 20:20:24) Deg: Example: when explorers helped Victor track down Phil.
(12/04 20:20:34) Michael Engberg: Setting up hoods, we know there will be many who want to help.
(12/04 20:21:28) Tweek: Think of it like this...a baby when learning to walk nee
(12/04 20:21:28) Tweek: eek
(12/04 20:21:28) Tweek: sorry about that wrong people
(12/04 20:21:44) Michael Engberg: Think of it this way, say we all wanted to help set up play
(12/04 20:22:25) Strife: could we reserve the concert hall if we did set up a play?
(12/04 20:23:03) Ford Prefect: yes, the play is the thing, the verry thing
(12/04 20:23:09) Tweek: could do Romeo and Julliet of D'ni...plent of balconies ;)
(12/04 20:23:14) The World: quintin> I don't believe anyone needs to 'take over' really. there's a pretty good Q&A session going on here. ;)
(12/04 20:23:33) Christoph05: I would like to see the curtains come down, just let us see what you are doing, we will be careful
(12/04 20:23:37) Michael Engberg: say 100,000 wanted to help at once. The DRC needs to just make it easier for each and everyone of you to do your part.
(12/04 20:23:47) LaReh: Once the KI is working, we can play marker games and quests to pass the time until we are needed for exploration
(12/04 20:24:15) Tweek: yes..esspecially if strife remakes his marker game
(12/04 20:24:15) Deg nods his head
(12/04 20:24:15) Tweek: hint hint  :P
(12/04 20:24:15) Strife: *grin*
(12/04 20:24:32) Michael Engberg: if 1000,00 people try to build the set at once, chaos happens.. do you agree?
(12/04 20:24:43) The World: yep.
(12/04 20:25:07) LaReh: true
(12/04 20:25:07) Taliametris: If you give 1000 people nothing much to do, chaos ensues
(12/04 20:25:16) Christoph05: Are you implying there will be positions "given" to us? Not chosen by us?
(12/04 20:25:19) Rodnik: play heek
(12/04 20:25:39) Rodnik: if your bored
(12/04 20:26:25) Michael Engberg: Chris I think you will see more and more, its just hard to restore and also tell everything
(12/04 20:26:44) Arnium: IMO he is saying that the DRC intends to be the governing body in the caern.
(12/04 20:27:04) Strife: i think what is the biggest problem is that we the explorers haven't done anything to help, except give feedback on what does & doesn't work
(12/04 20:27:04) Taliametris: Is alreay fulfilling that role, Arnium
(12/04 20:27:12) Tweek: soundslike you need a group that searches through information choosing what to release and when and to act like spokes people for the DRC
(12/04 20:27:17) Christoph05: Maybe you need someone in the DRC to report advancements/ changes daily michael
(12/04 20:27:31) Strife: i haven't seen one explorer pick up a cone and place it where it needs to go
(12/04 20:27:31) Michael Engberg: no way am I saying we want to govern the cavern
(12/04 20:27:32) Christoph05: that should be all they are supposed to do
(12/04 20:27:38) Strife: only kick them around.
(12/04 20:28:40) Michael Engberg:  I really must leave, but again all I really wanted to say is lets all try to be family, and lets all try to get along.
(12/04 20:28:56) Arnium: ?shout that was not necessarily a criticism Michael.
(12/04 20:28:57) Michael Engberg: thanks
(12/04 20:28:57) Tweek: Michael, do you know when the nexus links will be back?
(12/04 20:28:57) Deg claps his hands
(12/04 20:29:01) Tweek: ok thanks Michael
(12/04 20:29:33) Arnium: ?shout thank you micheal
(12/04 20:29:34) Strife: i agree with you michael and thanks for your time
(12/04 20:29:35) Deg: Thanks Micheal
(12/04 20:29:35) Taliametris: Thank you
(12/04 20:30:47) LaReh waves
(12/04 20:30:47) LaReh: Hi Ayli!
(12/04 20:31:07) Tweek: I think the DRC are learning tho...I mean look how much the talk to us now to how much they used to
(12/04 20:31:09) Ford Prefect: did someone log this?
(12/04 20:31:15) Tweek: Ford> I did
(12/04 20:31:17) Ayli: How long Mr. Engberg been talking?
(12/04 20:31:20) bonz: yes
(12/04 20:32:04) To Quintin: Later, Quintin
(12/04 20:32:33) Tweek: to turn the water on
(12/04 20:32:33) Taliametris: I would like to know the answer to that Envie
(12/04 20:35:14) To Michael Engberg: Thanks for the talk session, MR Engberg . . .will go a long way to calming randomly choppy waters.
(12/04 20:35:45) From Michael Engberg in  Nexus: you really think so?
(12/04 20:35:57) To Michael Engberg: Anything you'd like to add to the chatlog?
(12/04 20:36:34) To Michael Engberg: Yes I do . . . it didn't sound like it . . . but
you'd be surprised at how the loudest objections get changed afterwards
(12/04 20:37:13) From Michael Engberg in  Nexus: just tell them I stink of talking in big crowds
(12/04 20:37:20) To Michael Engberg: I know I feel sorry about making the remarks I did
(12/04 20:39:20) To Michael Engberg: You did great tonight . . . the background chatter will always be there . . . but we do connect the dots
(12/04 20:40:08) To Michael Engberg: Tink'll leave ya be now
