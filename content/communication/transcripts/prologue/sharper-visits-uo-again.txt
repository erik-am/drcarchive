(12/22 18:14:13) attila: Shorah, Mr. Douglas.
(12/22 18:15:04) Thanakar: why aren't you wearing the Hand shirt Doug?
(12/22 19:15:24) Douglas Sharper: I'm not sure.
(12/22 19:15:34) Douglas Sharper: I just wanted to wear something more plain today.
(12/22 19:15:45) Moiety Jean: Understand that feeling
(12/22 19:15:54) Moiety Jean: What brings you to our hood?
(12/22 19:16:13) To Douglas Sharper: Just making sure you are still 'with her' is all
(12/22 19:16:18) Douglas Sharper: Of course I am
(12/22 19:16:22) Thanakar: thanks
(12/22 19:16:30) Douglas Sharper: Did you all hear the news?
(12/22 19:16:38) Thanakar: yes..teh drc has gone too far
(12/22 19:16:47) Thanakar: You were not harming anything
(12/22 19:16:50) Frolain: yeah, Brian was by earlier
(12/22 19:17:00) From Douglas Sharper: understand what?
(12/22 19:17:14) Thanakar: eh?
(12/22 19:17:17) Douglas Sharper: sorry
(12/22 19:17:28) Douglas Sharper: How many of you are upset about the DRC's recent decision?
(12/22 19:17:37) Thanakar: I for one am
(12/22 19:17:43) attila: I am. They have no right to do this.
(12/22 19:17:44) Moiety Jean: Will you fill me in? I hadn't checked the news today...
(12/22 19:17:50) Douglas Sharper: Have you posted such on the forums?
(12/22 19:17:54) K'Huunah: he's on top of the fountain...
(12/22 19:17:56) Thanakar: the DRC took his tree pub and his hood away from him
(12/22 19:17:58) Douglas Sharper: They took my pub and they took my neighborhood.
(12/22 19:18:01) Moiety Jean: I only just heard that they took away the egg room again.
(12/22 19:18:11) Moiety Jean: The pub too? :(
(12/22 19:18:18) Douglas Sharper: Yes, the pub too.
(12/22 19:18:23) Thanakar: hello John
(12/22 19:18:32) Douglas Sharper: It's a sad day.
(12/22 19:18:37) Moiety Jean: I wish we could all be enlisted to help clean the pub
(12/22 19:18:55) Thanakar: i for one am very upset by these heavy handed actions of the DRC
(12/22 19:18:59) Douglas Sharper: You can all be enlisted to give me back the pub.
(12/22 19:19:10) Moiety Jean: the damage looked bad, but it could be fixed...
(12/22 19:19:14) To an'nie: any closer an'nie and we'd be legally married in 5 states
(12/22 19:19:17) Douglas Sharper: They must hear that people are upset. You must communicate if you disagree with their decision.
(12/22 19:19:29) Douglas Sharper: That is not the Great Tree Pub.
(12/22 19:19:31) From an'nie: lol
(12/22 19:19:34) Douglas Sharper: That is the Kahlo Pub.
(12/22 19:19:41) Frolain: If you have no hood do you want to join ours? :)
(12/22 19:19:52) Thanakar: All that are supporting you are joining togetehr and signing a list
(12/22 19:19:57) Douglas Sharper: I do not know that I am going to join any right now.
(12/22 19:19:58) Moiety Jean: Which is the one on Ae'gura?
(12/22 19:20:00) Thanakar: and we are going through the hoods voicing our displeasure
(12/22 19:20:09) Douglas Sharper: I have no reason to bring the DRC's wrath on any other hoods.
(12/22 19:20:35) Douglas Sharper: Excellent, hopefully the DRC will see that there are those who will not tolerate such action.
(12/22 19:20:39) Thanakar: the one in Ae'gura is the Kahlo pup
(12/22 19:20:42) Frolain: good point. But it's a much greater action if they were to do it to a larger hood
(12/22 19:20:57) Douglas Sharper: True.
(12/22 19:21:05) an'nie: do you have any thoughts on yesterday conversation with Engberg?
(12/22 19:21:23) Douglas Sharper: I didn't hear about the conversation. What was it?
(12/22 19:21:37) Thanakar: party line propoganda
(12/22 19:21:41) an'nie: well typical no answer kind of deal
(12/22 19:21:44) Thanakar: its how he found out about yoru hood and private room
(12/22 19:21:54) Douglas Sharper: That and Zardoz
(12/22 19:21:57) an'nie: he contradicted himself quite a bit
(12/22 19:22:05) Douglas Sharper: Did you read the post of this Zardoz fellow?
(12/22 19:22:11) Thanakar: which one?
(12/22 19:22:15) Thanakar: he's posted several
(12/22 19:22:16) an'nie: regarding what Phil is doing now
(12/22 19:22:32) Douglas Sharper: This anger about not getting into the hood. Watson seemed to like it.
(12/22 19:22:37) Douglas Sharper: What rubish.
(12/22 19:22:41) Douglas Sharper: Pitiful.
(12/22 19:23:06) an'nie: can you create a new hood?
(12/22 19:23:08) Thanakar: the DRC does seem to take satisfaction in thwarting you
(12/22 19:23:24) Douglas Sharper: They have taken away my ability to do so right now.
(12/22 19:23:30) Thanakar: Ouch
(12/22 19:23:33) Douglas Sharper: My KI is "damaged".
(12/22 19:23:38) To an'nie: Not very many hand shirts tonight
(12/22 19:23:39) Frolain: I didn't know they coud do that .. harsh
(12/22 19:23:53) Douglas Sharper: And I'd rather not now anyway.
(12/22 19:23:53) Frolain: anything else broken about it?
(12/22 19:23:58) Thanakar: whats to keep them from doing the same to us?
(12/22 19:24:09) Bad Speller: nothing
(12/22 19:24:11) Douglas Sharper: For those who argued that I was doing the wrong thing, maybe they'll enjoy no private rooms.
(12/22 19:24:18) Douglas Sharper: Nothing.
(12/22 19:24:24) Douglas Sharper: Is to keep them.
(12/22 19:24:28) Thanakar: Total control is not a good thing
(12/22 19:24:39) Douglas Sharper: I agree.
(12/22 19:24:47) Thanakar: Hawhat is that saying...absolute power corrupts absolutely?
(12/22 19:24:56) Frolain: Do you know how they are controling this aspect fo the KI?
(12/22 19:25:02) Douglas Sharper: Laxman magic.
(12/22 19:25:09) K'Huunah: lol
(12/22 19:25:12) Douglas Sharper: Ha.
(12/22 19:25:12) Frolain: figured as much
(12/22 19:25:16) Thanakar: same way they knew Tink had contacted phil
(12/22 19:25:21) Douglas Sharper: They control more than you think through the Nexus.
(12/22 19:25:29) Douglas Sharper: It's their answer to Relto.
(12/22 19:25:39) an'nie: i have other concerns about our ki
(12/22 19:25:45) Douglas Sharper: They control the cavern for the most part. With or without Yeesha.
(12/22 19:25:49) Thanakar: There should be a way to bypass the nexus..so far we only need it for the city
(12/22 19:25:52) Frolain: Can they get to private ages and reltos?
(12/22 19:26:14) Douglas Sharper: None of them have used a Relto book that I'm aware of. Too dangerous. Ha.
(12/22 19:26:29) Frolain: wow, so weird
(12/22 19:26:45) To an'nie: dang..gonna miss alot ofthis..company coming over shortly :(
(12/22 19:26:53) Frolain: their definition of dangeous is more askew than I realized
(12/22 19:27:06) Douglas Sharper: Well look at the private rooms. Were they dangerous?
(12/22 19:27:09) an'nie: Do you think our messages on our ki that are private are really private?
(12/22 19:27:09) K'Huunah: dangerous to their control, not to us... ;)
(12/22 19:27:10) Douglas Sharper: Hardly...
(12/22 19:27:25) Douglas Sharper: I would not doubt they have some way to listen to all messages.
(12/22 19:27:26) From an'nie: poo
(12/22 19:27:27) Thanakar: the only dangerous part was me falling through hte floor trying to jum into them
(12/22 19:27:30) Douglas Sharper: I have no proof but I would not doubt it.
(12/22 19:27:35) K'Huunah: i think we can say nothing in the cavern is private...
(12/22 19:27:41) Douglas Sharper: That's why they closed the private rooms
(12/22 19:27:49) Thanakar: I don't think anything you send via the KI is private
(12/22 19:27:50) an'nie: yes thats what I think
(12/22 19:27:51) Douglas Sharper: They were one of the few places that was secure.
(12/22 19:28:05) Douglas Sharper: Of course that didn't go over well with them.
(12/22 19:28:11) Frolain: are we sure even there was secure?
(12/22 19:28:21) Douglas Sharper: Fairly. I've done "tests".
(12/22 19:28:33) Thanakar: ...in the year 2525...
(12/22 19:28:41) an'nie: maybe thats why the delay maybe they are trying to make it so they can hear???
(12/22 19:28:50) Douglas Sharper: Maybe.
(12/22 19:28:59) Frolain: If I read Teek's log correctly it seemed they could hear him sometime I thought they couldn't
(12/22 19:29:30) Thanakar: what are you going to do now Doug?
(12/22 19:29:33) Douglas Sharper: The private rooms are secure. I'm almost sure of it. More than anything else.
(12/22 19:29:44) Douglas Sharper: I'm going to wait and see what the people do.
(12/22 19:29:47) Thanakar: we are doing what we can
(12/22 19:29:57) Thanakar: trying to gain support
(12/22 19:29:57) Douglas Sharper: I'm afraid my future is in your hands for the most part.
(12/22 19:30:03) attila: Is there any way we can get the private rooms back?
(12/22 19:30:08) Douglas Sharper: The DRC will not even speak to me.
(12/22 19:30:11) Douglas Sharper: I have tried.
(12/22 19:30:24) Bad Speller: what can we do?
(12/22 19:30:28) Douglas Sharper: I'm fearful of getting kicked out altogether if I'm not careful.
(12/22 19:30:31) Thanakar: You are powerless, phil is in captivity...I guess it iS up to us
(12/22 19:30:34) Douglas Sharper: I have to be careful right now.
(12/22 19:30:39) an'nie: I think we should get an eggroom open and you need to stay inside there as much as possible out of their reach
(12/22 19:30:47) Douglas Sharper: Unless they know that people are behind us, I'm afriad I can't do much.
(12/22 19:30:48) Thanakar: what about Zandi..he posted a message at teh DRC site
(12/22 19:30:56) Douglas Sharper: That sly devil.
(12/22 19:30:58) Douglas Sharper: Ha!
(12/22 19:31:03) Thanakar: a message that was quickly covered up
(12/22 19:31:12) Douglas Sharper: I could use a good dose of Zandi right now.
(12/22 19:31:24) Douglas Sharper: Watch the DRC flip out.
(12/22 19:31:32) Thanakar: seems they did
(12/22 19:31:35) Douglas Sharper: I hope he has something planned.
(12/22 19:31:41) lost pupil: what did zandi say?
(12/22 19:32:02) Thanakar: I dont ahve the exact message
(12/22 19:32:06) Douglas Sharper: Another of his strange vague messages.
(12/22 19:32:08) Thanakar: i wish I had wrote itdown
(12/22 19:32:16) Douglas Sharper: I would bet he has something more coming.
(12/22 19:32:21) Thanakar: Path of the shell...
(12/22 19:32:22) Douglas Sharper: Somethign about shells wasn't it?
(12/22 19:32:28) Douglas Sharper: Yes, path of the shell.
(12/22 19:32:35) Douglas Sharper: That's right.
(12/22 19:32:50) lost pupil: and what is the shell refering too?
(12/22 19:32:55) Douglas Sharper: I don't knwo.
(12/22 19:32:59) Frolain: was that the shape yeesha made at the end of the journey
(12/22 19:33:02) Douglas Sharper: Could you hold on one second?
(12/22 19:33:04) Thanakar: a closed hand
(12/22 19:33:06) Bad Speller: a new age?
(12/22 19:34:06) Stephanie Wilcox: hi corona, remember Riven Gurl?
(12/22 19:35:24) To lost pupil: 'we think it means that the path is circular..it finishes where it starts.
(12/22 19:35:40) From lost pupil: makes sense
(12/22 19:36:01) Douglas Sharper: I'm getting together some new shirts for those of you who don't have them.
(12/22 19:36:12) Thanakar: thanks
(12/22 19:36:17) Douglas Sharper: Hopefully the shipment will come in soon
(12/22 19:36:21) Armando Morgan: thanks
(12/22 19:36:22) Thanakar: ...blasted telephone....
(12/22 19:36:42) Frolain: That's cool, how will we know when you get them?
(12/22 19:36:54) Douglas Sharper: Maybe the jackets will help show support for the Great Tree Pub.
(12/22 19:37:08) Douglas Sharper: You will just have to check your closet.
(12/22 19:37:30) Douglas Sharper: Taliametris - long time no see.
(12/22 19:37:31) Thanakar: If its all the same with you..I"ll continue to wear my Yeesha shirt :)
(12/22 19:37:36) Douglas Sharper: How have you been?
(12/22 19:37:41) Frolain: ah, I didn't realize it was direct delivery :)
(12/22 19:37:43) Douglas Sharper: No problem Thanakar.
(12/22 19:37:55) Douglas Sharper: How goes your group?
(12/22 19:38:15) Douglas Sharper: And what do you think of what you have seen?

(12/22 19:38:28) Stephanie Wilcox: hi all
(12/22 19:38:35) Douglas Sharper: I had heard you were forming a group of your own.
(12/22 19:38:40) Douglas Sharper: Must be bad information.
(12/22 19:38:51) Thanakar: no...I'm not
(12/22 19:39:10) To Douglas Sharper: Tweek is the one starting his own gruop..the Third Path
(12/22 19:39:16) Armando Morgan: perhaps you're thinking on Brian Fioca
(12/22 19:39:22) Armando Morgan: *of
(12/22 19:39:29) Thanakar: Brian is just trying to orgainze Sharper supporters
(12/22 19:40:07) Douglas Sharper: Brian is trying to encourage those who disagree with what has happened to voice their concerns.
(12/22 19:40:09) Douglas Sharper: That is all.
(12/22 19:40:17) Douglas Sharper: Which I encourage him 100 percent.
