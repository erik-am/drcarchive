Michael Engberg: okay Brian what did you want to talk about?
Brian Fioca: I was interested in discussing the state of affairs down here...
Michael Engberg:  cool  Brian what would you like to know?
Dan'ni: hey Mr. Engberg or can I call you Mike? ;)
Michael Engberg: Dan, ya
Brian Fioca: why are you keeping information from us?
Brian Fioca: i realize you're working hard on restoration
Brian Fioca: but, with all the silence and delays, and delays about silence...
Brian Fioca: it doesn't help your cause about sticking to the rules when you go about breaking them yourself
Michael Engberg: OKay  Brian what information do you want?
To Brian Fioca: Has he replied to anything you said? I haven't heard him... but he's running around like an insane person....
Brian Fioca: What have you discovered about the creatures, the Bahro?
Michael Engberg: Why do you want to know that?
Brian Fioca: ha! because we would like to explore it!
Michael Engberg:  So Brian you asked to talk about the state of the cavern, but now you want information on the Bahro?
Brian Fioca: I think they have something to do with what's going on with Phil.
Michael Engberg: Why do you believe that? Could you tell me your theory?
Brian Fioca: I think they have something to do with what's going on with phil
Dusante: we were told they would effect the restoration
Brian Fioca: we don't even know if they're a danger to us
Michael Engberg:  we know those ages are safe
Brian Fioca: why? because that way you can make sure we don't find out your secrets?
Michael Engberg:  the ones with the stamp
IMForeman: They mean made safe, Brian.
Michael Engberg:  Brian don't assume you know everything, I said safe
Brian Fioca: the advantage you have with this dictatorship of yours is you can wipe all of the ages clean before anyone gets there
Brian Fioca: i don't know everything! ha! that is the problem
Michael Engberg: again assuming
Brian Fioca: there are others who agree with me on this
Brian Fioca: many
Michael Engberg:  Honestly if you really wanted to know state of  the cavern thats fine, but to assume and belittle the DRC. Well I just don't have time for it
IMForeman: I agree with Michael.
Michael Engberg:  Thank you IMF
IMForeman: No prob
Brian Fioca: what is the state of the cavern then?
Brian Fioca: the state of the cavern?  i'm interested now
Brian Fioca: how are things down here?
Michael Engberg: Well, the state of the cavern, currently we opened the courtyard.
Brian Fioca: sigh
Brian Fioca: really?
Brian Fioca: what are the plans for the next opening?
IMForeman: The DRC have been very kind and polite to me since they invited me here.
IMForeman: It's the brigade of people Zandi let in that have been assuming some grand conspiracy
Michael Engberg: The nexus has been having some problems, and we are working on the KI more everyday.
Brian Fioca: good.  upgrades?
Brian Fioca: to the ki?
Michael Engberg: Laxman has been working on a few things, Its talked about in his BIO on the website, www.drcsite.org
IMForeman: Michael, do you know what state K'Veer is in?  Has restoration started on it. 
IMForeman: Last time I asked Kodama, it wasn't being touched yet
Michael Engberg: IMF, I am currently in Er'cana  so I don't really keep up on other areas
Brian Fioca: and the library?
IMForeman: Ok.  Thanks.
Brian Fioca: ok
Brian Fioca: when will that be open
Brian Fioca: rough guess
To Michael Engberg: Sorry for interrupting. But I have heard reports that the library was once opened to the explorers. A simple explanation on why it was closed again will help. I have heard many conspiracy theories from your critics.
Michael Engberg: John, I will address this Publicly..
John Lynch: Okay. Thanks.
Michael Engberg: Some people have said that other areas of the city were open and are now closed
Michael Engberg: If explorers  were in those other areas, this was before the cavern was open to the public.
Brian Fioca: understood
Michael Engberg: Some might have heard that its not open now, but with the major amount of public we needed to close areas off.
Michael Engberg: Sorry for the inconvience.
John Lynch: Aaaah. So your restricting areas to ensure visitors don't destroy important artifacts by accident until you can secure the area better?
IMForeman: Or get killed, John.
IMForeman: I can understand that... how many people do you think that Bridge would support at once?
IMForeman: Particularly that rope one
Michael Engberg: IMF who really knows, or wants to find out?
IMForeman: Not me...
plinthon: could we have access to a map... so we can identify some of thestructures?
IMForeman: There was one here once. 
Michael Engberg: I'll talk to the DRC about giving a map out.
Michael Engberg: Maybe even put it  on the site.
IMForeman: The last thing that anyone needs down here is for an Explorer to be killed by unsafe structures.
IMForeman: Best to play it a bit cautious
[Note: Brian Fioca sends a private message to Michael Engberg]
Michael Engberg: Brian, I don't leak anything..
Michael Engberg: loose lips sink ships
Brian Fioca: interesting
Brian Fioca: so you do have something to hide then?
Michael Engberg:  Its just a saying..
Brian Fioca: i see
Brian Fioca: that it is
Michael Engberg:  again its just a saying.
Brian Fioca: yup
Brian Fioca: you're right
Michael Engberg: Brian, I will bring up the concern about giving more information out
Brian Fioca: Thank you Michael
Brian Fioca: that's all we ask
Brian Fioca: it'll make a difference
Brian Fioca: but
Brian Fioca: it has to be done
Brian Fioca: no more delays
John Lynch: Mr Engberg. Just a small question. Could you explain why certain information needs to be kept secret or slowly released to the public? I have read transcripts where you said it's important to slowly release the information. I can't understand why though...
Michael Engberg: John, Dr. K is thinking about giving all the information about ages out.
Michael Engberg:  I just believe that giving some information at a time is better then  all at once.
Michael Engberg: we will see what the DRC agrees with.
Brian Fioca: why is that?
Brian Fioca: what possible reason is there for that?
Michael Engberg: Well, Say I only knew your name
Brian Fioca: which you do
Brian Fioca: :)
Michael Engberg:  Its hard to explain, let me try my best
John Lynch: Thanks a lot for taking the time out from your important work in Er'Cana Mr Engberg. It's greatly appreciated.
Brian Fioca: sure
Brian Fioca: i'm a reasonable person
Michael Engberg: say we  know age names of 50 places
Michael Engberg: yes we can give out those names.
Michael Engberg:  but wouldn't it be better to really research the  1 age and give  one age at a time?
Brian Fioca: well, it might be good to release information incrementally about the age
Brian Fioca: earlier in the cycle
Michael Engberg: give you all the information on that one age  in a more detailed form, pictures, maybe movies, a nice docunment.
Michael Engberg: then just giving you a bunch of names?
Brian Fioca: well, the problem is more complicated than that
IMForeman: I can just imaging if the DRC gave out early info that later turned out to be a wrong guess... then people like youself would accuse them of lying
Michael Engberg: IMF, that too,
John Lynch: That makes sense. However if you already know the 50 names before you begin researching 1 age in depth, why not just release the 50 names? Sure a details form would be nice. But if you already know the 50 names, why not bother telling them as well? I imagine it wouldn't take much effort if you already have the information.
Michael Engberg: John, its more on what IMF had to say, wrong information. Name changes cause the D'ni wasn't translated right.
John Lynch: Oh okay. So the information you haven't released, your unsure as to  it's reliability?
Brian Fioca: who's to say you've already hidden information by the time you release everything
Brian Fioca: *haven't alredy i mean
Michael Engberg: Brian, people will think what they wil. No matter what we do.
Brian Fioca: nobody, but we wouldn't know if they were
Brian Fioca: you understand that this civilization was more advanced than our own
Brian Fioca: there is a likelyhood that they have information that could give some people lots of power
Brian Fioca: and you could understand why they would want to keep it to them selves, could you not?
Michael Engberg: Brian what information do you really think we have?
Brian Fioca: i... there's no way to know
Brian Fioca: sigh
Michael Engberg: The DRC always needs to look over information before we release anything.
Brian Fioca: for safety, right
John Lynch: Brian. Instead of assuming they're guilty of something. Why not assume they're innocent of something and look at the evidence from that standpoint?
Brian Fioca: John, I'll look at it from another perspective if you will
Michael Engberg: Brian, there are so many unknowns down here.
Brian Fioca: i understand Michael
Brian Fioca: believe me
Michael Engberg: Columbus thought he sailed to India, then called the native americans Indians, look how that has entered history books.
John Lynch: Good point. I would rather not have inaccuracies written in text books. Ancient Egyptian textbooks are annoying in that regard.
IMForeman: It seems to me, Brian, that you are basing all this off Sharper's ill-will... and Sharper aint the nicest guy in the world
IMForeman: In fact, he's highly questionable
Brian Fioca: Sharper's not around... he's going with phil i think
John Lynch: What!? What makes you think that Brian?
Brian Fioca: rumors
IMForeman: I doubt Phil would keep Sharper around.
IMForeman: Phil seems concerned about things... Sharper's a killer.
Brian Fioca: killer??
IMForeman: Not exactly a match made in Heaven
Brian Fioca: listen, Phil told me that sharper was kind to him
IMForeman: He killed one of the Teledahn Creatures
IMForeman: And sunk the body
Brian Fioca: are you sure?
IMForeman: Sold bits of it too.
Brian Fioca: have you seen it?
Michael Engberg: So many rumors about Sharper.
IMForeman: It's in his journal.
Brian Fioca: ha... reading peoples journals
IMForeman: Plus he's a Patriots fan... bah!
Brian Fioca: Sharper's an honest, hard working guy
Brian Fioca: I respect his committment to helping fix up the place
Michael Engberg: I don't go read other people private stuff, and I have never even seen his journal.
IMForeman: I think he made it very easy to find, Michael.  He seemed to want it to be found
IMForeman: His journal makes very interesting reading.
John Lynch: Yes there are Mr Engberg. But despite the unorthodox methods of gaining the information, there doesn't seem much room for speculation....
John Lynch: Mr Engberg, have you even seen his office?
John Lynch: It has a very nice view of Kerath's Arch
Brian Fioca: I suppose you're going to take him there, John?
John Lynch: No need Brian. I'm sure he knows where it is and can get there himself.
Michael Engberg: His office?
IMForeman: The office overlooks the courtyard.
Michael Engberg: I need to go, talk later.. interesting.. Office... hmm
Brian Fioca: Alright, we're getting off topic here
IMForeman: Later, Michael
John Lynch: Bye Mr Engberg. And thanks.
Brian Fioca: Remember the meeting about giving more information
Brian Fioca: make sure it happens
From Brian Fioca: What are you doing?
To Brian Fioca: What? Didn't the DRC know about his office? I've heard it's right above the the Takotah building
To Brian Fioca: How could they NOT know?
From Brian Fioca: if he reads the joural, they'll know about his hiding things from them
To Brian Fioca: He talks about the DRC coming into his office in his journal a fair bit. Besides, I'm not the one bringing up his journal. I haven't told the DRC anything about Sharper they didn't already know. Other people dobbed him in about the Shroomie hunting.
From Brian Fioca: ok
From Brian Fioca: i over reacted
To Brian Fioca: Has Sharper shown you his secret books anyway? He seems just as bad as the DRC with his hidden information.
From Brian Fioca: no
From Brian Fioca: but you understand him having to be careful, right? if they found out he has them...
To Brian Fioca: Of course. But we already know he has them. We could do a fair bit of damage already. Showing us the books wouldn't add to the risk by much more.
From Brian Fioca: I have a feeling he's waiting until there are a large enough group of people
To Brian Fioca: Hopefully.
Brian Fioca: Phil is in the nexus
