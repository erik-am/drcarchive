(12/02 09:30:17) To Strazsha: dont' let him bait you into giving away secrets about douglas
(12/02 09:30:22) albert: lol

(12/02 09:30:38) Dane: like loc ness?
(12/02 09:30:39) Michael Engberg: But have you heard anything else?
(12/02 09:30:41) Strazsha: She's been around but not too close
(12/02 09:31:03) Knottyboy: same here, are you planning on killing her?
(12/02 09:31:22) Knottyboy: Brian said something about hunting last night
(12/02 09:31:32) From Strazsha: I just didn't want him to leave!
(12/02 09:31:44) To Strazsha: you've done well hon LOL
(12/02 09:32:00) Michael Engberg: I heard a Rumor Doglas is.. if thats the case we really need to talk to him about it..
(12/02 09:32:16) Knottyboy: We'll make sure he gets the message
(12/02 09:32:30) Michael Engberg: Brian?
(12/02 09:32:41) Michael Engberg: Whos Brian?
(12/02 09:32:44) Knottyboy: I would hope the drc isn't santioning the destruction or capturing of a novel speices here
(12/02 09:32:52) Knottyboy: Brian Fioca
(12/02 09:33:08) Michael Engberg: Knotty, we wouldn't dare
(12/02 09:33:29) Knottyboy: Just checking, seems like we''re the last to know
(12/02 09:33:44) Michael Engberg: What was Brian saying?
(12/02 09:33:58) Knottyboy: We want this transition to go as smoothly as you do
(12/02 09:34:19) Michael Engberg: Thanks Knotty
(12/02 09:34:26) Knottyboy: To be careful
(12/02 09:34:42) Michael Engberg: careful of shroomie?
(12/02 09:34:57) Knottyboy: np, we do appreciate all your hard work believe us
(12/02 09:35:09) Knottyboy: Not exactly
(12/02 09:35:32) Michael Engberg: Knotty, then of what?
(12/02 09:36:07) Knottyboy: Of people that don't have our best interests at heart
(12/02 09:36:28) Michael Engberg: Does Brian?
(12/02 09:36:38) Knottyboy: I believe he does
(12/02 09:36:42) Dane: Michael, sorry to change the subject but, who would know what other linking books will be placed in the 'hoods?
(12/02 09:36:47) Michael Engberg: our best interest?
(12/02 09:37:04) Michael Engberg: Dane not at this time.
(12/02 09:37:09) Knottyboy: Yes, Micheal everyone's
(12/02 09:37:11) Dane: Ok.
(12/02 09:37:26) Michael Engberg: Knotty, you mean the DRC?
(12/02 09:37:47) Knottyboy: Michael can I give you some advise?
(12/02 09:37:50) Strazsha (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(12/02 09:38:10) Michael Engberg: I'm always willing to listen
(12/02 09:38:39) Knottyboy: The main difference about the DRC and the others, brian, douglas etc... is
(12/02 09:38:55) Knottyboy: That they mingle with us, talk up close and personal
(12/02 09:39:19) Knottyboy: It's hard to feel warm and fuzzy about the drc when you're standing behind the barriers
(12/02 09:39:45) Knottyboy: It would be a start in painting a more trusting picture of what the DRC is doing
(12/02 09:40:22) Michael Engberg: Douglas isn't for the same thing the DRc is?
(12/02 09:40:54) Knottyboy: True, but at least he's taking a chance and coming to visit with us personally
(12/02 09:41:41) Knottyboy: You're body language speaks volumes to all of us
(12/02 09:41:43) Michael Engberg: KNotty.. I asked.. have you heard if dougls doesn't want to listen to the DRC?
(12/02 09:42:08) Knottyboy: We will relay a message to him
(12/02 09:42:28) Michael Engberg: Knotty I am asking you
(12/02 09:42:38) Knottyboy: honestly I can't tell you
(12/02 09:43:24) kelm: hi everybody
(12/02 09:43:29) Michael Engberg: HMm.. So I am suppose to come be chatty with people who don't tell me whats going on, and keep secrets behind the DRC backs?
(12/02 09:43:46) Strazsha: Knotty can't speak for someone else
(12/02 09:43:52) Knottyboy: Well if you keep treating us like children what do you expect?
(12/02 09:44:09) Michael Engberg: I must leave
(12/02 09:44:18) Rand: Whoa, this sounds deep!
(12/02 09:44:34) Knottyboy: We're all adults here, some are older than you, we want information to make good decisions, you're not helping by being cagey
(12/02 09:44:35) Michael Engberg: Knotty thank you for the insight.
(12/02 09:44:53) Rand: What's up with him?
(12/02 09:45:02) Strazsha: good question!
(12/02 09:45:11) Knottyboy: He's not pleased with me
(12/02 09:45:23) Rand: What did you do?
(12/02 09:45:34) Knottyboy: this cat and mouse game has gone on for far to long
(12/02 09:45:40) albert: il est ou?
(12/02 09:45:57) Rand: ????
(12/02 09:52:17) Rand: I link in at least every day, sometimes more. Just checking things out.
(12/02 09:52:24) To Strazsha: shorah rand
(12/02 09:52:32) Knottyboy: shorah rand
(12/02 09:52:33) Dane: ok.
(12/02 09:52:38) Rand: What was the argument with Engberg?
(12/02 09:52:49) Rand: Hey Knotty!
(12/02 09:52:58) Knottyboy: Precisely this
(12/02 09:53:49) Rand: ?
(12/02 09:53:51) Knottyboy: That we're wanting to helps this operation and Endberg is demanding information we don't have
(12/02 09:54:16) Rand: What does he want to know. I don't get it.
(12/02 09:54:29) Knottyboy: He wants more information about Douglas
(12/02 09:54:38) Rand: Oh.
(12/02 09:55:04) Rand: Douglas has somethin' going on I've heard.
(12/02 09:55:13) Knottyboy: Some of us saw Brian Fioca last night and he cautionted us not to get to close with the drc
(12/02 09:55:27) Knottyboy: Just to be careful
(12/02 09:55:34) Rand: Hmmm...
(12/02 09:56:20) Rand: Always good to be careful, but...
(12/02 09:56:27) J'nilou: we hope to see you in the first french neigorhood : Guilde URUNIVERS(1) , I think you know BlasterCalm wich is the webmaster of great french site
(12/02 09:56:30) Knottyboy: but what?
(12/02 09:56:32) From kelm: why doesnt he ask douglas him self with out going behind his back
(12/02 09:57:00) Knottyboy: Why doest he ask douglas himself
(12/02 09:57:06) Rand: Seems's like stuff is goin' on - on both sides.
(12/02 09:57:08) To kelm: thanks
(12/02 09:57:27) Knottyboy: whoa
(12/02 09:57:33) Dr Kodama: Can I help you?
(12/02 09:57:40) Rand: All I know is that I trust Watson. I've known him for a long time.
(12/02 09:59:07) Knottyboy: Thats all well and good, but its seems like Michael has a lot of contempt for us being here
(12/02 09:59:17) Knottyboy: Like we're holding him up
(12/02 09:59:46) Rand: They are moving slowly... the DRC. I think they were forced into letting everyone in
(12/02 10:00:01) Rand: Zandi forced the issue
(12/02 10:00:03) Strazsha: Dr. Kodama is here too now
(12/02 10:00:13) Crazy Toque waves
(12/02 10:00:21) Knottyboy: Well I can't see their point, but a thousand eyes is better than a few
(12/02 10:00:59) Rand: Yeah. Watson just has this thing about safety...
(12/02 10:01:21) Knottyboy: Its very frustrating to feel powerless in a place that has so much to offer
(12/02 10:01:23) Rand: But at least he's nice about it
(12/02 10:01:31) Kha'tie: Hi everyone
(12/02 10:01:32) Rand: Not like some other DRC members
(12/02 10:01:36) Knottyboy: Thats cool, I'm with you on that
(12/02 10:01:41) Knottyboy: most of us are
(12/02 10:02:21) Dane: hello
(12/02 10:02:54) From Rand: I still think something is going on with the DRC.
(12/02 10:02:55) Knottyboy: look at you Rand, you're here, out with the masses and talking. Michael's talking to us from behind barriers. Doesn't make for good DRC relations in my books
(12/02 10:03:05) To Rand: You got it
(12/02 10:03:20) To Rand: and we do know more than we are telling
(12/02 10:03:30) Rand: Yeah, sometimes I don't understand them either.
(12/02 10:03:36) To Rand: for now we're holding our cards close to the chest
(12/02 10:03:44) Rand: Kodama is here though, where is he?
(12/02 10:04:20) l-vizz: hi all
(12/02 10:04:21) From Rand: probably better that way
(12/02 10:04:35) To Rand: Gotcha
(12/02 10:04:44) Rand: Any new stuff lately?
(12/02 10:05:05) albert: I don't know
(12/02 10:05:08) Rand: I heard about a Yeesha page somewhere.
(12/02 10:05:20) Taliametris: Hi there
(12/02 10:05:28) Taliametris: Dr Kodama went through the door over there
(12/02 10:05:31) Knottyboy: Yes was in the hoods for a while
(12/02 10:05:41) Taliametris points
(12/02 10:05:42) Rand: ...for a while?
(12/02 10:05:43) Knottyboy: now its gone again, what's she up to?
(12/02 10:05:47) albert: on est 16 en ville
(12/02 10:05:51) Rand: Hmmmm
(12/02 10:05:52) albert: 17
(12/02 10:05:56) Taliametris: No one needs a key apparently
(12/02 10:06:01) Taliametris: he refused to open it for me
(12/02 10:06:06) Taliametris: or give me a key
(12/02 10:06:16) Dane: their had been one down in the hallway, by the docks
(12/02 10:06:26) Dane: a page I mean...
(12/02 10:06:29) Rand: It's gone too?
(12/02 10:06:32) Taliametris: I see Rand is in the city - is he upstairs?
(12/02 10:06:39) Dane: seems to be...
(12/02 10:06:51) Kha'tie: Where is everyone?
(12/02 10:06:51) Dane: but at least I used it.
(12/02 10:07:01) Rand: Any word on when the barrier at the top will be removed?
(12/02 10:07:04) Crazy Toque: they are all upstairs
(12/02 10:07:06) Knottyboy: But only a few got it, but they've been generous with sharing it
(12/02 10:07:10) Rand: Dane: What was it?
(12/02 10:07:13) Taliametris: Upstairs I believe they must be
(12/02 10:07:27) Knottyboy: Shorah Kha/tie
(12/02 10:07:29) Dane: it was a dock on the side of the relto island
(12/02 10:07:34) Rand: How do you share it?
(12/02 10:07:55) Rand: Thats cool. Like Myst!
(12/02 10:08:03) Dane: you can share relto pages?
(12/02 10:08:05) Knottyboy: Preach got a link in his Teledahn book, then he would let us link to this relto and use it
(12/02 10:08:16) Dane: yes Rand minus the water and stoneship...
(12/02 10:08:17) Cyron Xerrox: Why is the game so ###### slowy all over sudden?
(12/02 10:08:34) Dane: 'heek?
(12/02 10:08:40) Rand: Oh, a Bahro Linking Stone. Not a Yeesha page.
(12/02 10:08:41) l-vizz: really slow
(12/02 10:08:59) Knottyboy: yes, but the link leads to the Yeesha page
(12/02 10:09:13) Rand: Oh, gotcha!
(12/02 10:09:31) Dane: I'm lost where is the new Bahro stone?
(12/02 10:09:35) Cyron Xerrox: oic
(12/02 10:09:59) Knottyboy: Rand, thanks for showing up. Nice to see a friendly face
(12/02 10:10:13) Tijara: hi everyone
(12/02 10:10:29) Cyron Xerrox: hi Tijara
(12/02 10:10:30) Rand: Haven't been in much at this time. I'll try it more often.
(12/02 10:10:30) Knottyboy: Shorah tijara
(12/02 10:10:30) praefect (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(12/02 10:11:10) Strazsha: he's probably upstairs behind the barriers
(12/02 10:11:11) Tijara: what's going on?
(12/02 10:11:32) Rand: (I've heard rumors of bug fix and lag fixes coming - that'll help.)
(12/02 10:11:32) Knottyboy: Rand man's in the hizzouse
(12/02 10:11:53) Spider: hi
(12/02 10:12:00) Tijara: Hi Rand
(12/02 10:12:02) Cyron Xerrox winkt
(12/02 10:12:11) Knottyboy waves
(12/02 10:12:12) Taliametris waves
(12/02 10:12:14) Rand: Hi Tijara
(12/02 10:12:24) Strazsha: Engberg said 'this week, very soon"
(12/02 10:12:36) Rand: I hope so.
(12/02 10:12:54) Taliametris: It would really help to know when there is a common problem
(12/02 10:13:08) Taliametris: At the moment I keep getting kicked out with an auth response failure
(12/02 10:13:24) Rand: Took a picture. :)
(12/02 10:13:34) Cyron Xerrox: Mee too :)
(12/02 10:13:40) l-vizz: me too :-)
(12/02 10:14:00) Knottyboy: How many people were put in this time? New explorers
(12/02 10:14:03) Rand: What is Kodama up to - where is he?
(12/02 10:14:09) Cyron Xerrox: I just saw someone sitting. How can I do this?
(12/02 10:14:13) Strazsha: Engberg said we wouldn't be able to get to the library
(12/02 10:14:14) Rand: I don't know.
(12/02 10:14:29) Tijara: Cyron tyoe / sit (without the space)
(12/02 10:14:32) Rand: I been to the library
(12/02 10:14:35) Strazsha: so maybe JUST the courtyard will be opened
(12/02 10:14:44) Cyron Xerrox: Sorry I have the german version of the game
(12/02 10:14:49) Rand: When
(12/02 10:15:01) Rand: No problem Cyron
(12/02 10:15:13) Cyron Xerrox: so english commands won't work
(12/02 10:15:16) Rand: I wish I spoke German. :)
(12/02 10:15:24) Rand: ...and French. :)
(12/02 10:15:25) l-vizz: cyron just enter /sit. even in the german version
(12/02 10:15:39) Cyron Xerrox klatscht
(12/02 10:15:46) Cyron Xerrox: Gee thanks
(12/02 10:15:49) To Tijara: this is so COOOOOOL
(12/02 10:15:52) l-vizz: works fine cyron :-)
(12/02 10:16:18) Rand: When did Engberg say?
(12/02 10:16:41) Knottyboy: posted in our KI's in a couple of days
(12/02 10:16:53) Knottyboy: he confirmed that too
(12/02 10:17:30) Strazsha: Kodama is probably behind the barriers upstairs\
(12/02 10:17:42) Taliametris: I saw him go through the door downstairs
(12/02 10:17:43) Rand: Wow. DRC is trying to work fast.
(12/02 10:17:47) Tijara: teasing us ;)
(12/02 10:18:06) Taliametris: I asked him to let me in, but he refused
(12/02 10:18:16) Cyron Xerrox: Does someone know how I can get to D'ni Rudenna?
(12/02 10:18:24) Rand: He's usually working on something.
(12/02 10:18:31) Strazsha: german 'sit'
(12/02 10:18:51) Dane: well, it is a big place. staff and all how many are rebuilding down hear?
(12/02 10:18:58) Yor Feix: hi, where is everyone?
(12/02 10:19:08) To Cyron Xerrox: I believe that rudenna is another name for the bahro caves with the pillars
(12/02 10:19:09) Rand: Rudenna is a portion of the cavern. 
(12/02 10:19:19) G'ildor: Dr. K. just walked past us!
(12/02 10:19:27) Taliametris: I saw him sink through the floor
(12/02 10:19:28) Knottyboy: fell into the floor
(12/02 10:19:29) Dr Kodama: You have quite a crowd Mr. Miller.
(12/02 10:19:51) Dr Kodama points
(12/02 10:19:51) Rand: Hi Dr. Kodama.
(12/02 10:20:10) Knottyboy: Shorah Dr. Kodama
(12/02 10:20:19) Rand: How's the city restoration going?
(12/02 10:20:45) Dr Kodama: On schedule.
(12/02 10:20:50) Rand: What's behind the door you went through?
(12/02 10:21:09) Dr Kodama: Docks.
(12/02 10:21:23) Tijara: will they be opened sometime in the near future?
(12/02 10:21:33) Rand: Is the DRC working on the Ferry area?
(12/02 10:21:39) Dr Kodama: Hopefully. We're working on them. Yes.
(12/02 10:21:57) Rand: Any boats left?
(12/02 10:22:00) Tijara: what's that in your right hand Dr. ?
(12/02 10:22:00) Tadd: is there anyone who can help me with the Relto dock page?
(12/02 10:22:10) Dr Kodama: Sunken boats.
(12/02 10:22:49) To Tadd: talk to preachr46 when you see him
(12/02 10:22:56) To Tadd: he'll help you out
(12/02 10:23:02) Dr Kodama: Pipe
(12/02 10:23:10) Rand: Any chance of raising them - be fun to float around the harbor.
(12/02 10:24:03) Dr Kodama: We have talked about it. Future plans.
(12/02 10:24:06) Knottyboy: is the algae brightening up as you'd hoped, Dr. Kodama?
(12/02 10:24:07) Tijara: what's the pipe for/from?
(12/02 10:24:12) Rand: Cool!
(12/02 10:24:12) Dane: it would also let us see many historical sights
(12/02 10:24:51) Dr Kodama: Good question. We are currently running tests on lake light levels. Should have an answer soon.
(12/02 10:25:05) Rand: Is the bridge still broken, Dr. Kodama?
(12/02 10:25:47) Dr Kodama: Which bridge Mr. Miller?
(12/02 10:26:01) Rand: The one in the canyon.
(12/02 10:26:25) Dr Kodama: Ah. Yes. It's a major break. Will be broken for some time.
(12/02 10:27:07) Rand: It's a very cool bridge. Interesting design and construction.
(12/02 10:27:09) Dr Kodama: We might have a temporary fix however.
(12/02 10:27:39) Dr Kodama: The D'ni were masters at their craft.
(12/02 10:28:06) Rand: I've got to go. Nice visiting with you all!
(12/02 10:28:16) Dr Kodama: As do I. Work to do.
(12/02 10:28:18) Cyron Xerrox: Bye Mr. Miller
(12/02 10:28:18) Knottyboy: Ciao rand
