(12/04 21:16:02) Al'my: thx phil
(12/04 21:16:09) Jon: Phil, why doesn't the DRC want us to have these pages? Why did they take them down?
(12/04 21:16:13) Duskrin D'tahree: I see... Phil. Can I ask you, where you were while you were missing to the DRC?
(12/04 21:16:25) Snerticus: I would love to get the city page
(12/04 21:16:33) phend: i don't know
(12/04 21:16:36) Thanakar: I see, butI can't get to it
(12/04 21:16:38) phend: they don't see
(12/04 21:16:47) Jaden: after i got it, victor laxman ran into that room and then it was gone.
(12/04 21:16:47) Theora: We believe in you Phil... but please remember that while we have eyes, they are still human
(12/04 21:16:49) Thanakar: got it..thanks
(12/04 21:16:52) Duskrin D'tahree: You were with the least? the Bahro?
(12/04 21:17:06) Jon: I saw them
(12/04 21:17:08) Thanakar: Duskin, the least were the creatures
(12/04 21:17:11) Thanakar: oops..fhil just fell
(12/04 21:17:25) phend points
(12/04 21:17:26) phend: thank you
(12/04 21:17:26) Duskrin D'tahree: that was interesting
(12/04 21:17:36) Jaden waves
(12/04 21:17:41) Thanakar: Duskin, have you ever been up on the balcony here that has the stone carving?
(12/04 21:17:53) Duskrin D'tahree: I do not know.
(12/04 21:18:02) Duskrin D'tahree: I have been many places.
(12/04 21:18:03) Thanakar: it shows two bahro caves
(12/04 21:18:15) Thanakar: it also shows that the least adn the bahro are the same
(12/04 21:18:26) Thanakar: yeesha told us that the pillars represent the journey
(12/04 21:18:38) Thanakar: and that the return of the pillars is teh reutrn of the bahro
(12/04 21:18:42) Thanakar: the giving away and the giving back
(12/04 21:18:44) Duskrin D'tahree: I've seen them once. Heard them many times.
(12/04 21:19:03) Jaden: I think each time we complete the circle, another bahro is released.
(12/04 21:19:18) Duskrin D'tahree: Just as I've seen Yeesha. I am far too analytical to... I do not know.
(12/04 21:19:20) Thanakar: you also saw them entre the volcano
(12/04 21:19:26) phend: yes
(12/04 21:19:44) phend: you are being used
(12/04 21:19:45) Jon: Why does Yeesha want them to return to D'ni?
(12/04 21:19:46) Thanakar: or have you not witnessed them enter the volcano?
(12/04 21:19:53) Duskrin D'tahree: I wished I had Phil's vision. His understanding
(12/04 21:19:58) Snerticus: Jaden, we use and are used, that's the cycle
(12/04 21:20:03) phend: you will
(12/04 21:20:03) Thanakar: he has seen more than us
(12/04 21:20:07) Jaden: I meant maliciously
(12/04 21:20:14) Jaden: I do not mind if it's for a good cause.
(12/04 21:20:28) Thanakar: phil..what are the bahro and how are they connected to the D'ni?
(12/04 21:20:33) Duskrin D'tahree: Used? The DRC uses us? They hardly seem to acknowledge us
(12/04 21:20:56) Jaden: And why didn't Atrus ever mention them?
(12/04 21:21:01) Jaden: Perhaps not even he knew
(12/04 21:21:05) Thanakar: Shorah Arcamis
(12/04 21:21:09) phend: the least
(12/04 21:21:10) Theora: Thank you for everything Phil. Your words inspire me, and many others, I'm sure...
(12/04 21:21:15) Snerticus: maybe because then we didn't need to know
(12/04 21:21:18) Duskrin D'tahree: The bahro, are the least. They were the beings which the D'ni used, in their harsh pride, as slaves.
(12/04 21:21:19) phend: good
(12/04 21:21:20) Thanakar: yes, the least
(12/04 21:21:21) Arcamis: Shorah smile.gif
(12/04 21:21:29) Raiden: Shorah phil
(12/04 21:21:34) phend: thank you theora, you are very kind
