(12/29 19:28:47) stickyboot: no sun in d'ni
(12/29 19:28:58) Douglas Sharper: The city is no more dangerous then it ever was.
(12/29 19:29:06) Douglas Sharper: At least the portions that were avaialble to us.

(12/29 19:29:19) Dr.Dos: hmm waht about phil - is he allive?
(12/29 19:29:24) Douglas Sharper: I don't know.
(12/29 19:29:33) Douglas Sharper: I am not optimistic though.
(12/29 19:29:37) Douglas Sharper: I have seen the rubble pile.
(12/29 19:29:37) stickyboot: the DRC says he is
(12/29 19:29:49) Shu: is there any way we can find out for sure?
(12/29 19:29:55) Douglas Sharper: I don't think they do. They said they will hold out hope he is alive.
(12/29 19:30:09) Douglas Sharper: They do not think he is though.
(12/29 19:30:23) Dr.Dos: can we help to find him?
(12/29 19:30:50) albert: sit down guys
(12/29 19:30:51) Douglas Sharper: No the rubble pile is gigantic. They have machines up there. Very unstable area to begin with.
(12/29 19:30:52) Alyphe: Excepted you, who can we trust now?
(12/29 19:31:12) Douglas Sharper: Laundry.
(12/29 19:31:20) Alyphe:  :)

(12/29 19:31:57) Douglas Sharper: The hats you stole didn't you?
(12/29 19:32:07) Douglas Sharper: I don't think the DRC is handing out hats.
(12/29 19:32:12) Dr.Dos: stole? no never!
(12/29 19:32:16) :-)kateR: we found them
(12/29 19:32:25) Douglas Sharper: Did someone give them to you?
(12/29 19:32:26) Alyphe: i'll never wear a drc hat
(12/29 19:32:33) Douglas Sharper: If not, you stole it.
(12/29 19:32:39) Iku: they were on the tables
(12/29 19:33:06) :-)kateR: we have to save our heads
(12/29 19:33:13) Iku: available for everybody
(12/29 19:33:18) :-)kateR: things break down here
(12/29 19:33:19) Douglas Sharper: So if something is on a table, it must be free to take. I'll be careful what I leave on my table.
(12/29 19:33:25) Alyphe: What can you tell to us about gahreesen?
(12/29 19:33:31) Dr.Dos: but think savety first?!
(12/29 19:33:32) Deg: You would the DRC, with their big concern for safety, would want us to wear them.

(12/29 19:35:14) Douglas Sharper: Last time I opened an area, I was discipline by the DRC and no one came to my aid - to speak of.
(12/29 19:35:16) stickyboot: if Cyan actully hopes to make a successful game, they have to let the player actully play it
(12/29 19:35:21) Douglas Sharper: I'm not opening anymore areas soon.

(12/29 19:36:37) Alyphe: Have you seen the creatures that laxman seen in gahreesen? must we be afraid about it?
(12/29 19:36:50) Douglas Sharper: I believe the hats were for DRC members exploring the rubble and you took them.
