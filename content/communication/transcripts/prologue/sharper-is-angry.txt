(12/16 16:47:04) Tarl Raven: Have you managed to contact him since he was taken?
(12/16 16:47:23) Douglas Sharper: Of course not. They have taken him and have no intention of allowing anyone to speak with him.
(12/16 16:47:28) Raidun: hello everybody
(12/16 16:48:03) Solaris: what are we to do?!!!
(12/16 16:48:11) Foo: phil was spending a long amount of time in the nexus recently
(12/16 16:48:17) Douglas Sharper: We are to raise trouble.
(12/16 16:48:22) Clarissa: Why do you think he'd been taken?
(12/16 16:48:25) Solaris: how??
(12/16 16:48:34) Foo: waaahooo! trouble is my favourite, lol
(12/16 16:48:36) Douglas Sharper: They didn't like his power or his message.
(12/16 16:48:51) Foo: so we are to spread his message?
(12/16 16:49:01) Clarissa: What was his message?
(12/16 16:49:06) Douglas Sharper: People listened to him and he did not always speak very well of the DRC. Ha! He hated them.
(12/16 16:49:25) Foo: sometimes i agree with him
(12/16 16:49:26) Douglas Sharper: So they have taken him. Who knows where? Against his will.
(12/16 16:49:32) Douglas Sharper: Like the tyrants they are.
(12/16 16:49:41) Foo: i expect they taken his KI
(12/16 16:49:44) Tarl Raven: Definitely against his will, and a bad move to confiscate his book
(12/16 16:49:53) Douglas Sharper: His KI and Relto Book.
(12/16 16:49:57) Douglas Sharper: He has no escape.
(12/16 16:50:05) Foo: who was responsible for it?
(12/16 16:50:11) Foo: do you know?
(12/16 16:50:14) Douglas Sharper: Laxman and Watson were the ones there yesterday.
(12/16 16:50:22) Douglas Sharper: Laxman took his Book.
(12/16 16:50:25) Clarissa: Can we find him?
(12/16 16:50:26) Solaris: Are they trying to do the same to you Mr Sharper?
(12/16 16:50:42) Douglas Sharper: Good luck. Phil hesitated.
(12/16 16:50:48) Douglas Sharper: And I won't.
(12/16 16:51:15) Tarl Raven: I don't think Phil thought he was in danger at the time, despite your warning
(12/16 16:51:20) Foo: what should we do? rebel against DRC rules?
(12/16 16:51:38) Clarissa: Weren't you the one into man hunting, Douglas?
(12/16 16:51:50) Andrea: Solaris, how do you sit down?
(12/16 16:51:53) Douglas Sharper: Not in danger? He was taken! What do you call that?
(12/16 16:52:19) Douglas Sharper: Man hunting? Me?
(12/16 16:52:20) Tarl Raven: You saw he was in danger, he didnt see it himself
(12/16 16:52:27) Douglas Sharper: No he didn't.
(12/16 16:52:34) Tarl Raven: Until it was too late for him to react
(12/16 16:52:41) Douglas Sharper: Phil is not that way. Wants to trust everyone.
(12/16 16:52:46) Clarissa: Something about that in your journal
(12/16 16:52:47) Enjah: Hi everybody
(12/16 16:53:13) Foo: we need a plan
(12/16 16:53:26) Elspeth: Mr. Sharper, do you have any idea where Phil is being held?
(12/16 16:53:32) Tarl Raven: Have you thought about what you need to do now, Douglas
(12/16 16:53:32) Douglas Sharper: I am working on one. Working out my anger and working on a plan.
(12/16 16:53:39) Elspeth: Whether there is anything we can do, but wait?
(12/16 16:53:41) Enjah: What's going on, guys?
(12/16 16:53:43) Elspeth: And share the journey?
(12/16 16:53:49) Enjah: Who is Phil?
(12/16 16:53:55) Douglas Sharper: We'll need people. Lots of them. Supporters.
(12/16 16:54:02) Foo: you've got them.
(12/16 16:54:11) Douglas Sharper: We will demand Phil be released.
(12/16 16:54:13) Elspeth: Phil Henderson. Long story. Check out the logs at Archives of the Restoration.
(12/16 16:54:28) Douglas Sharper: Phil was a friend of ours.
(12/16 16:54:29) Elspeth: Mr. Sharper, why would they listen to us?
(12/16 16:54:29) Andrea: Douglas, we need a leader, lead!
(12/16 16:54:35) Tarl Raven: And if they refuse, Douglas?
(12/16 16:54:44) Foo: then we ove4rthrow them.
(12/16 16:54:57) Elspeth: They hold the keys, foo.
(12/16 16:55:09) Foo: but why do they hold the keys?
(12/16 16:55:10) Elspeth: Notice how you have to use your KI to identify yourself every time you use the Nexus?
(12/16 16:55:16) Foo: we could run D'ni without them
(12/16 16:55:19) Douglas Sharper: They will not be able to refuse!
(12/16 16:55:23) Douglas Sharper: Not with numbers.
(12/16 16:55:29) JB Whitter: So what wise words do you have for us today Douglas?
(12/16 16:55:30) Elspeth: I don't want this to be about power, but currently... they have the power.
(12/16 16:55:54) Foo: power is not something that should be given to a small number of people
(12/16 16:56:00) Elspeth: I could write some cool protest songs, but... <shrug>
(12/16 16:56:05) Douglas Sharper: They do unless people protest that power. There are more of us than them.
(12/16 16:56:07) Foo: it should be split, and democracy should rule.
(12/16 16:56:10) Elspeth: Foo, power isn't always given.
(12/16 16:56:11) Douglas Sharper: For now, spread the word.
(12/16 16:56:18) Foo: we will.
(12/16 16:56:26) Douglas Sharper: We need people willing to protest.
(12/16 16:56:43) Douglas Sharper: Perhaps we will storm the city and tear down barriers.
(12/16 16:56:43) Foo: im with you.
(12/16 16:56:46) Enjah: How and to whom do we protest?
(12/16 16:56:56) Foo: Wahey! tearing down barriers sounds fun
(12/16 16:57:08) Douglas Sharper: I'm already working on my own neighborhood. Opening up what they have closed to us.
(12/16 16:57:09) Lucas: doug->hope this question isn't asked before but did you hear anything from phil or dr. watson?
(12/16 16:57:16) Douglas Sharper: I have heard nothing.
(12/16 16:57:23) Douglas Sharper: Even now the DRC doesn't tell us what they have done.
(12/16 16:57:27) Douglas Sharper: Who do they think they are?
(12/16 16:57:29) iska: ???
(12/16 16:57:33) Foo: should we all wear our journey shirts?
(12/16 16:57:38) Douglas Sharper: Yes!
(12/16 16:57:48) Douglas Sharper: To support Phil, wear the shirt he spoke of so often.
(12/16 16:57:49) Foo: ok, im putting mine on very soon.
(12/16 16:57:55) Douglas Sharper: Spread the word to others.
(12/16 16:58:11) Tarl Raven: Despite what they've done to Phil, we shouldn't drop to the level of kidnapping ourselves though
(12/16 16:58:12) Douglas Sharper: It will encourage us all.
(12/16 16:58:22) Douglas Sharper: And we will get Phil back soon.
(12/16 16:58:26) Elspeth: Good grief, Raven, no.
(12/16 16:58:29) Douglas Sharper: Not by taking him!
(12/16 16:58:33) Elspeth: There must be another way.
(12/16 16:58:44) Douglas Sharper: By forcing the DRC to give him back. To give him his freedom!
(12/16 16:58:44) oclee: Don't you think your littlt campaign with phil has escalated things?
(12/16 16:58:49) Foo: shorah, that is what the d'ni would say, peace to all
(12/16 16:59:13) Foo: we must remain peaceful, but demand justice
(12/16 16:59:15) Douglas Sharper: Very well. You can sit here and say peace. I will get Phil back.
(12/16 16:59:17) Tarl Raven: To show that there is now a need for more freedom of movement here
(12/16 16:59:18) Loriendil: And how will you do that?
(12/16 16:59:26) Douglas Sharper: And when they take you, I will sit here and say peace.
