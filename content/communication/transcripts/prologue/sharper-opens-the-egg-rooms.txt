(12/19 13:01:28) Douglas Sharper: i'm going to talk and see if you can hear me whe the door is closed.
(12/19 13:01:45) Brian Fioca: nothing
(12/19 13:01:56) Brian Fioca: perfectly silent
(12/19 13:02:06) Brian Fioca: nope
(12/19 13:02:10) Douglas Sharper: Coulc you hear me?
(12/19 13:02:15) Brian Fioca: no, could you hear me?
(12/19 13:02:18) Douglas Sharper: no
(12/19 13:02:20) Douglas Sharper: Very good.
(12/19 13:02:21) Brian Fioca: nice
(12/19 13:02:27) Douglas Sharper: I'm inviting people who are not necessarily followers.
(12/19 13:02:32) Brian Fioca: ok
(12/19 13:02:34) Douglas Sharper: They need to see how safe it is in here.
(12/19 13:02:40) Brian Fioca: good idea
(12/19 13:02:41) Douglas Sharper: That the DRC is closing for no reason.
(12/19 13:02:50) Douglas Sharper: Meanwhile we can use the rooms for private conversations.
(12/19 13:02:51) Brian Fioca: yeah, this is the safest place i've seen so far
(12/19 13:03:00) Douglas Sharper: Indeed.
(12/19 13:03:03) Brian Fioca: maybe that's why they blocked it off, to private
(12/19 13:03:15) Douglas Sharper: One of the reasons I have considered.
(12/19 13:04:06) Douglas Sharper: Did you go to a hood and tell people the rooms are open?
(12/19 13:04:11) Douglas Sharper: I've had people contacting me.
(12/19 13:04:15) Douglas Sharper: Good job if you have.
(12/19 13:04:18) Brian Fioca: yes
(12/19 13:04:20) Brian Fioca: the UO hood

(12/19 13:10:05) Douglas Sharper: You aren't able to invite people here correct?
(12/19 13:10:05) From plinthon in D'ni-Ae'gura: hehehe
(12/19 13:10:14) Brian Fioca: correct
(12/19 13:10:20) Brian Fioca: i'm still with my own hood
(12/19 13:10:20) Douglas Sharper: Hmm...good and bad.
(12/19 13:10:25) Brian Fioca: maybe i should join

(12/19 13:10:51) Solaris: anything I can do to help?
(12/19 13:11:02) Douglas Sharper: Hmm...anyone I invite here could invite others if they chose?
(12/19 13:11:16) Brian Fioca: well
(12/19 13:11:24) Brian Fioca: i don't think so
(12/19 13:11:33) Brian Fioca: not unless they used your relto to link in and join
(12/19 13:11:39) Solaris: I assume it is for those who support Yeesha and you Douglas
(12/19 13:11:53) Douglas Sharper: As I told Brian, I don't mind others seeing it.
(12/19 13:12:03) To kami: get some more people to PM sharper asking for invites
(12/19 13:12:05) Douglas Sharper: To see how safe it is, beyond a closed DRC door.
