(12/11 19:28:18) Victor Laxman: overall it seems the cavern systems are handling the recent arrivals quite well
(12/11 19:28:25) !Njck_Yap!: mind me.... but when will we get to see the new ages?
(12/11 19:28:53) Victor Laxman: ah...new ages...always a ready question eh?
(12/11 19:29:02) !Njck_Yap!: yes it is... heh
(12/11 19:29:04) Jaden: You can imagine our suspence.
(12/11 19:29:08) Jaden: suspense I mean LoL
(12/11 19:29:22) Victor Laxman: we have several Ages in varying phases of approval
(12/11 19:29:53) Victor Laxman: one of the Ages that is furthest along is Er'cana
(12/11 19:30:06) Starfire: Have you spoken to Phil recently?
(12/11 19:30:12) !Njck_Yap!: a sneak peak of what's to come?
(12/11 19:30:14) Victor Laxman: I don't recall what information Watson has authorized for release with Er'cana
(12/11 19:30:40) Victor Laxman: but I was actually thinking we may enlist your help with a project in the cavern itself before that
(12/11 19:30:53) Jaden: ? We're listening!
(12/11 19:30:54) jess: what do you need us to do?
(12/11 19:30:57) Starfire: I'm in and ready to explore
(12/11 19:31:02) Victor Laxman: this is something I've only begun to discuss with the rest of the council
(12/11 19:31:20) Victor Laxman: you may have heard of the Great Zero?
(12/11 19:31:26) Jensen: yes
(12/11 19:31:27) Starfire: Yes
(12/11 19:31:30) Jaden: Yeah
(12/11 19:31:31) Jaharen: yeah
(12/11 19:31:35) jess: i've heard of it, not much about it though
(12/11 19:31:48) Victor Laxman: it's a marvelous piece of machinery
(12/11 19:32:03) Victor Laxman: that is correcy Reid
(12/11 19:32:17) Victor Laxman: it's an engineering marvel that became almost a religious icon
(12/11 19:32:23) Victor Laxman: or perhaps the other way round
(12/11 19:32:48) Victor Laxman: in any case, it's turned out to be a much larger project than I and my team anticipated
(12/11 19:33:04) jess: anything we can do to help?
(12/11 19:33:24) Jaden: What do you want us to do Laxman?
(12/11 19:33:29) jess: yeah, let's hear some more about this great zero
(12/11 19:33:36) Victor Laxman: I'm devising a way for anyone who's interested to assist us in restoring it...but again, I've only begnu discussions with this among the council
(12/11 19:34:20) Victor Laxman: so I'm here trying to guage interest in this kind of endeavor
(12/11 19:34:22) Jaden: Sounds awesome
(12/11 19:34:34) jess: sounds intriguing, i'd be interested
(12/11 19:34:35) Jaharen: count me in
(12/11 19:34:40) Victor Laxman: is it something that sounds interesting? or are you just looking for the next Age ;)
(12/11 19:34:43) Starfire: I'm ready, willing, and able!!!
(12/11 19:34:44) Jaden: Yeah me too, anything to help explore and retore!
(12/11 19:34:47) Jaden: restore I mean
(12/11 19:35:09) Jaharen: i'm definitely interested
(12/11 19:35:40) Jensen: I don't want to go to any age before it is fully restored and approved by the DRC, I have seen some without DRC approval, and it wasn't always pretty
(12/11 19:35:56) jess: that was the impression i had reid, but it sounds like some sort of machine, can you tell us more about it victor?
(12/11 19:35:59) Victor Laxman: we're talking specifically about the Great Zero Njck
(12/11 19:36:15) Victor Laxman: yes it's a massive machine that sits atop Ae'gura
(12/11 19:36:48) Jaden: By restore I mean make D'ni a living, breathing place again.
(12/11 19:36:54) Starfire: Are you going to be opening more of Ae'gura soon?
(12/11 19:36:59) Victor Laxman: restore - reestablish - reinstate - renew - recover...
(12/11 19:37:23) Jaharen: whatever task i can help with, i'm in
(12/11 19:37:42) Victor Laxman: I'm the engineer on the team Njck - if you're interested in the culture and history of D'ni you'll have to speak with Watson or one of the others
(12/11 19:37:48) rcs: i also would like to help
(12/11 19:38:53) Victor Laxman: it is the reference point for the coordinate system on which D'ni was built
(12/11 19:39:13) Jaden: Non-functional?
(12/11 19:39:54) rcs: can we help to make it functional
(12/11 19:39:55) Victor Laxman: right - and quite a bit more I'm sure - we won't know it's full functionality until we can turn it back on I'm sure
(12/11 19:40:33) Victor Laxman: in any case it looks like I can tell the council that you all are ready and willing to help
(12/11 19:40:41) Jaden: Does it have some connection with the KI? Will we be able to use the KI as a GPS unit?
(12/11 19:40:44) Starfire: Yes we are
(12/11 19:41:01) Jaharen: that's the concensus
(12/11 19:41:21) jess: yup, i don't think you'll have any trouble finding helpers
(12/11 19:41:22) Victor Laxman: ah yes - ha - the fans, though not much of a challenge - they're a significant milestone in the restoration
(12/11 19:41:50) Jaden: Why are the fans so important?
(12/11 19:42:09) Jaharen: they bring fresh air into the cavern
(12/11 19:42:19) jess: so i guess i'm still unclear on this great zero...initially i thought it was just a point in space, but now it sounds like it will "do" something. any ideas on what that something is?
(12/11 19:42:42) Jaden: No kidding, but this cavern is so expansive we could live down here for years with no problems.
(12/11 19:42:46) Victor Laxman: it's more of a psychological accomplishment - they improve the air quality, but they were used againt the D'ni in the fall
(12/11 19:43:29) Victor Laxman: I'm afraid I've said all I should for now jess - but yes it's a rather grand machine
(12/11 19:43:50) Jaharen: let us know when you're recruiting
(12/11 19:43:52) Victor Laxman: oh yes cleaned throughly Reid and believe me they've been secured against any future threat
(12/11 19:43:57) jess: well, you definitely have me intrigued victor, if there's anything i cando to help let me know
(12/11 19:43:59) Jaden: Thanks for hanging out Victor, but I have to eat some dinner now. Seeya.
(12/11 19:44:15) Victor Laxman: goodbye Jaden
(12/11 19:44:15) jess: goodbye jaden
(12/11 19:45:11) !Njck_Yap!: By jaden!
(12/11 19:45:12) Bad Speller: cheers jaden
(12/11 19:45:14) Victor Laxman: in fact, it looks like there's a situation I should attend to in another neighborhood
(12/11 19:45:15) Jaharen: later
(12/11 19:45:15) Victor Laxman: I'm going to have to take my leave
(12/11 19:45:17) jess: thanks for talking with us, see you around
(12/11 19:45:19) Victor Laxman: thank you for your support everyone! be safe
