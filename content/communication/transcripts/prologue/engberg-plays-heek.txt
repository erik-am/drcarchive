(12/05 17:58:18) Duskrin D'tahree: I will admit that Phil seems a little... distracted. Yet I think the only way one can understand what happened to him, is to .. well humoring him is a strong term
(12/05 17:58:36) Navra: Why did Sharper want to see Yeesha?
(12/05 17:58:50) LaReh: There's a difference between being missing and not wanting to be found
