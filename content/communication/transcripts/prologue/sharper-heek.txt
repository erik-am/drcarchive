(11/24 21:04:22) Douglas Sharper: No it was good. Things progressing.
(11/24 21:04:27) Douglas Sharper: The pub.
(11/24 21:04:27) Dusante: oh
(11/24 21:04:35) Dusante: good, hehe
(11/24 21:04:35) Douglas Sharper: Slowly.
(11/24 21:04:50) Chwith: Seems to be the word of the day
(11/24 21:04:57) Dirk: When will we be able to visit your pub?
(11/24 21:05:19) Douglas Sharper: Some time away. I hope in a couple of months. Maybe three.
(11/24 21:05:30) Dusante: That's good
(11/24 21:06:00) Dirk: seems pretty far away
(11/24 21:06:33) Douglas Sharper: Yes, it is. Hopefully there will be enough in the meantime to keep you busy.
(11/24 21:06:41) Douglas Sharper: We'll see what the DRC can do.
(11/24 21:06:45) Dusante: Hopefully
(11/24 21:06:52) Dusante: the DRC hasn't released much though
(11/24 21:07:03) Dusante: and that ki message bout the great stairs
(11/24 21:07:08) Tweek: erm Im not following you Doug honest
(11/24 21:07:14) Tweek: hey guys
(11/24 21:07:15) Dirk: yeah i hope that to, if they just keep opening new sections of the city it would be okay
(11/24 21:07:33) Dusante: we've been able to get past the barriers on the stairs except for the top since last monday
(11/24 21:07:35) Dirk: yeah i saw it...
(11/24 21:07:43) Dirk: too bad
(11/24 21:07:49) Douglas Sharper: Right. They don't know that though.
(11/24 21:07:49) Dusante: if all they are doing is getting rid of 2 barriers and not the top, thats pretty, blah
(11/24 21:07:53) Douglas Sharper: Or don't care.
(11/24 21:07:56) Dirk: do you have any idea what is behind there?
(11/24 21:08:00) Dusante: darn
(11/24 21:08:15) Douglas Sharper: Oh yes. All the more confusing. It's plenty safe.
(11/24 21:08:21) Rockman_X: weird either my personal age is popular or i'm linking to the wrong one
(11/24 21:08:22) Douglas Sharper: Been safe for months.
(11/24 21:08:24) Dusante: some neat stuff past the barrier, the hall of kings is nice
(11/24 21:08:41) Douglas Sharper: Right.
(11/24 21:08:47) Tweek: I like the palace
(11/24 21:08:51) Dirk: then why are they keeping us from going there if it is safe?
(11/24 21:08:52) Dusante: its beyond my why they closed it all down again
(11/24 21:08:58) Lucas: been on the balconies to have a look, for what it's worth
(11/24 21:09:13) Douglas Sharper: A question you will have to ask them.
(11/24 21:09:19) Douglas Sharper: I have no idea.
(11/24 21:09:21) Douglas Sharper: Power?
(11/24 21:09:24) Douglas Sharper: Red tape?
(11/24 21:09:29) Dusante: yup
(11/24 21:09:30) Douglas Sharper: Ignorance.
(11/24 21:09:46) Dusante: I think the acronym DRC stans for something quite different
(11/24 21:09:54) Douglas Sharper: Don't get me going. I have to be careful. I still need them, as we all do.
(11/24 21:10:01) Dusante: yeah
(11/24 21:10:07) Dirk: true for sure
(11/24 21:10:18) Douglas Sharper: In time perhaps we can do something but for now, we have to live under them.
(11/24 21:10:30) Dusante: indeedy
(11/24 21:10:33) Lucas: time will give us answers
(11/24 21:10:37) Douglas Sharper: The more we acknowledge that, the better off we'll be now and later.
(11/24 21:10:38) Tweek: Drink Real Coke? hmm a warning to all the pepsi drinkers out there
(11/24 21:10:41) Chwith: we hope.
(11/24 21:10:42) Dusante: i gotta ask them about that age they were thinking of releasing
(11/24 21:10:53) Tweek: Dust> which age?
(11/24 21:10:58) Dusante: dont know
(11/24 21:10:59) Dirk: wich age?
(11/24 21:11:10) Rockman_X: all i need is a small glitch to let me past any barrier
(11/24 21:11:12) Dirk: havent heard that strory..
(11/24 21:11:13) Dusante: thats why we should ask,
(11/24 21:11:14) Rockman_X: : )
(11/24 21:11:15) Douglas Sharper: I'll let you in on a secret. The DRC is in a pickle with all this Yeesha stuff.
(11/24 21:11:23) Tweek: lol
(11/24 21:11:26) Dusante: I bet, hahaha
(11/24 21:11:38) Dusante: she even said the restoration wouldnt go as planned by others
(11/24 21:11:39) Douglas Sharper: They were expecting to release Ages that she already has. Thrown the plans all out of whack.
(11/24 21:11:45) Douglas Sharper: Ha!
(11/24 21:12:02) Chwith: hehe
(11/24 21:12:05) Douglas Sharper: I'd love to talk to Zandi. He must be running this thing.
(11/24 21:12:17) Douglas Sharper: Clever devil he is.
(11/24 21:12:17) Chwith: dunno
(11/24 21:12:23) Tweek: Dust> thats true and with more people taking her way to D'ni the more its going to impeid on the the restoration
(11/24 21:12:29) Dirk: yeah have seen heem once but then he disapeared
(11/24 21:12:43) Dusante: i dont blame him
(11/24 21:12:45) Douglas Sharper: I assume he'll be down here soon enough.
(11/24 21:12:48) Dusante: im sure hes safe
(11/24 21:12:53) Tweek: Zandi? yeah I havent seen him about lately
(11/24 21:13:00) Lucas: Michael Engard was here an hour ago
(11/24 21:13:01) Rockman_X: probably in the pub already
(11/24 21:13:07) Douglas Sharper: Engberg.
(11/24 21:13:13) Rockman_X: just chillin and waiting for us
(11/24 21:13:18) Douglas Sharper: I had heard. Telling you where you can't go?
(11/24 21:13:26) Lucas: yeah, but he was in the DRC(30 hood
(11/24 21:13:27) Douglas Sharper: Seems all he's good for lately.
(11/24 21:13:32) Tweek: hmm we need Yeesha Zandi and HEnderson all together and we can have a mad hatters tea party
(11/24 21:13:39) Dusante: thats all hes done yeah, wine an complain
(11/24 21:13:47) Dirk: yeah he was here somewhere, but we couldn´t find him, he only showed up on our ki´s
(11/24 21:13:48) Dusante: you should have seen his little spaz outside the bar last week
(11/24 21:13:50) Lucas: no he standed in front of the heek table, doing nothing actually
(11/24 21:13:52) Dusante: it was hilarious
(11/24 21:13:55) Lucas: he didn't speak
(11/24 21:14:08) Tweek: Dust> funny yes but now the thing is closed off
(11/24 21:14:13) Douglas Sharper: Well what could he say? Get away from the table?
(11/24 21:14:22) Dusante: i know, too bad.
(11/24 21:14:50) Tweek: well when we have to wear maintainers suit to play h eek i'll be happy...just cause I want a maintainers suit
(11/24 21:14:51) Douglas Sharper: Engberg used to be so relaxed. He's gotten tense lately.
(11/24 21:15:02) Lucas: that's to bad
(11/24 21:15:08) Dirk: yeah how come?
(11/24 21:15:10) Dusante: Must have been the thing that happened with phil
(11/24 21:15:20) Lucas: influence by someone maybe?
(11/24 21:15:29) Douglas Sharper: Not sure. Pressure maybe. Maybe Lucas.
(11/24 21:15:34) Tweek: pity I missed that I was in Kemo the otherday to
(11/24 21:15:54) Dirk: yeah that was some event..
(11/24 21:15:54) Dusante: poor phil, something crazy must have happened
(11/24 21:15:59) Tweek: what I want to know is how far into the cave he went, he must have gotten in further than I have
(11/24 21:16:06) Dusante: i mean we dont go crazy every time we enter the doors
(11/24 21:16:12) Douglas Sharper: Yes, Phil. That's an interesting topic.
(11/24 21:16:28) Dirk: what does the drc think happend?
(11/24 21:16:30) Lucas: yeah i heard about it, quite mysterious
(11/24 21:16:36) Dusante: must be because yeesha prepared us or something.
(11/24 21:16:40) Douglas Sharper: They are very quiet about it. Want to talk to him.
(11/24 21:16:49) Douglas Sharper: I know that.
(11/24 21:16:59) Tweek: he'll want to talk to him to when he's ready
(11/24 21:17:05) Tweek: *them
(11/24 21:17:12) Lucas: does anybody knows if Phil will come down here again?
(11/24 21:17:14) Dusante: they should just go in there themselves, im sure most of us could open the door for them
(11/24 21:17:28) Tweek: Dust> now now Safty first
(11/24 21:17:38) Dusante: Phil said he will return,
(11/24 21:17:40) Douglas Sharper: Ha!
(11/24 21:17:51) Douglas Sharper: Phil was half out of his mind from what I heard.
(11/24 21:17:58) Tweek: he sounded it
(11/24 21:17:59) Dusante: yeah he sounded like it
(11/24 21:18:01) Douglas Sharper: Who knows? I'd like to talk to him though.
(11/24 21:18:11) Douglas Sharper: Before the DRC does.
(11/24 21:18:16) Tweek: me too
(11/24 21:18:25) Tweek: I would love to find out what he saw
(11/24 21:18:34) Dirk: indeed i heard that to but atleast he returend, last time we heard of him he wanted to stay forever behind the door.
(11/24 21:18:49) Dusante: Well if anyone needs me to open the door, I'm here.
(11/24 21:18:51) Dusante: hehe
(11/24 21:19:13) Dusante: I wonder if the Bahro did something to him
(11/24 21:19:26) Tweek: Dust> I cant opent he door the DRC put me in a full body splint when i broke a nail opening it last time
(11/24 21:19:44) Dusante: sheesh
(11/24 21:19:52) Douglas Sharper: Ha!
(11/24 21:19:52) Tweek: I dont think they did something to him I think he saw something
(11/24 21:20:04) Dusante: I should fake my death, that will make the DRC loose some sleep
(11/24 21:20:06) Tweek: perhaps he foudn the city of the least
(11/24 21:20:15) Dusante: say I fell off garrison
(11/24 21:20:17) Douglas Sharper: Or close down the city. I wouldn't do that!
(11/24 21:20:46) Dusante: yeah guess it be best I stay alive
(11/24 21:20:53) Douglas Sharper: Don't give them something to react to. They'll kick everyone out and start all over.
(11/24 21:21:17) Douglas Sharper: Claiming safety.
(11/24 21:21:21) Dusante: good point
(11/24 21:21:28) Dirk: that would be bad! even worse then not letting us enter safe parts of the city
(11/24 21:21:33) Tweek: yeah then I cant start the great D'ni  tiddly winks champeonship
(11/24 21:21:45) Tweek: ahh my typo's seem to be peaking today
(11/24 21:21:50) Dusante: anyone notice something fishy about rawa?
(11/24 21:21:50) Douglas Sharper: Ha!
(11/24 21:22:00) Dusante: er Dr. Watson?
(11/24 21:22:07) Douglas Sharper: Well, which one?
(11/24 21:22:08) Dirk: never met him..
(11/24 21:22:17) Dirk: neither of them
(11/24 21:22:19) Dusante: Dr. Watson of the DRC
(11/24 21:22:26) Douglas Sharper: Ah. The good Dr.
(11/24 21:22:30) Dusante: He told me that he "doesn't open doors"
(11/24 21:22:54) Dusante: maybe thats why Sutherland is always with him, she opens the doors for him?
(11/24 21:22:57) Chwith: Well then we'll just have to.
(11/24 21:23:30) Douglas Sharper: He's a good man. Just a litle on the cautious side.
(11/24 21:23:46) Dusante: yeah, sounds like it.
(11/24 21:23:55) Dirk: that is how the drc should be.. cautious but not scared...
(11/24 21:24:04) Dusante: they seem scared
(11/24 21:24:14) Dusante: as if they know something dangerous
(11/24 21:24:21) Douglas Sharper: It's a thin line between cautious and scared.
(11/24 21:24:34) Douglas Sharper: Maybe they do.
(11/24 21:24:51) Douglas Sharper: Although I haven't heard anything.
(11/24 21:24:52) Lucas: douglas did you go to nobolen?
(11/24 21:24:53) Tweek: I cant blame them in a way, I mean D'ni is a strange alien place but I think they are being a tad over zealous
(11/24 21:25:06) Douglas Sharper: Ah. Noloben.
(11/24 21:25:20) Douglas Sharper: I'm trying to get a link. they keep it well protected.
(11/24 21:25:21) Dusante: im surprised they were going to open garrison for us, ive base-linked there so many times
(11/24 21:25:39) Dusante: and the lava in gira, so many close calls
(11/24 21:25:49) Douglas Sharper: You have to get a KI there. That's how they control your links through the Nexus. That's why Garrison.
(11/24 21:25:53) Lucas: to bad, would like some stories about shroomie
(11/24 21:25:56) Douglas Sharper: They didn't open Gira.
(11/24 21:25:57) Dusante: ah yeah
(11/24 21:26:03) Tweek: I just wish I had a higher KI version to open those other doors on Gahreesen
(11/24 21:26:05) Douglas Sharper: Shroomie. Ah yes.
(11/24 21:26:20) Douglas Sharper: What a beast.
(11/24 21:26:21) Tweek: Dust> well Lehsa felll off of KAdish lastnight
(11/24 21:26:36) Dusante: I keep the gates open for shroomie, one day I hope she eats a mushroom
(11/24 21:26:37) Douglas Sharper: Beautiful creature. Especially the big ones.
(11/24 21:27:00) Douglas Sharper: They haven't been coming in lately. Not sure what happened to her.
(11/24 21:27:08) Douglas Sharper: Getting scared. Or smart.
(11/24 21:27:19) Dusante: i think shroomie is pretty smart
(11/24 21:27:26) Dirk: i have seen here not so long ago, but she wouldn´t come verry near
(11/24 21:27:30) Dusante: dont know why, but shes gotta be
(11/24 21:27:37) Lucas: maybe to much going on lately for shroomie
(11/24 21:27:42) Douglas Sharper: Very smart. Clever.
(11/24 21:27:43) Dusante: she sure does scream alot though
(11/24 21:28:03) Chwith: I like her cry
(11/24 21:28:11) Dusante: too bad all the flappers are inside the gates though
(11/24 21:28:13) Douglas Sharper: I think the pods are moving away from where the people are. I'll try to work on some ways to draw her in.
(11/24 21:28:15) Chwith: very whal like.
(11/24 21:28:17) Dusante: cant lure her close enough
(11/24 21:28:21) Douglas Sharper: You all deserve a good look at her.
(11/24 21:28:42) Lucas: hopefully that day will come
(11/24 21:28:43) Dusante: yeah
(11/24 21:28:45) Chwith: cool
(11/24 21:28:46) Dirk: would ben very nice
(11/24 21:28:53) Tweek: indeed
(11/24 21:28:54) Dusante: wonder what the DRC thinks of her
(11/24 21:29:09) Douglas Sharper: Cautious. What else?
(11/24 21:29:13) Chwith: I think that's why they wanted the gun
(11/24 21:29:14) Tweek: lol
(11/24 21:29:15) Dusante: that mining gun seems a little, freaky
(11/24 21:29:24) Douglas Sharper: Believe me, they did not want the gun.
(11/24 21:29:29) Dusante: I hope nobody tries to shoot her
(11/24 21:29:31) Dirk: maby that is what she scared of
(11/24 21:29:44) Chwith: Then why is it there?
(11/24 21:29:51) Tweek: shoot her? <looks shifty>
(11/24 21:29:51) Dusante: yeah, but we had to use it to get to that upper slave room
(11/24 21:30:13) Dirk: since the drc wanted it there for our safety
(11/24 21:30:20) Tweek: nah I got a good view of her through the gun once. wouldnt shoot her tho
(11/24 21:30:20) Douglas Sharper: It's not there to shoot Shroomie, I'll tell you that.
(11/24 21:30:42) Dusante: hmm
(11/24 21:30:47) Chwith: I'd hope not.
(11/24 21:31:00) Dusante: have you seen more parts of teledahn than we have?
(11/24 21:31:06) Dusante: that map of tel is just amazing!
(11/24 21:31:07) Dirk: i was under the impression it was, then why is it there?
(11/24 21:31:49) Dusante: DRC has strange reasons
(11/24 21:31:50) Dirk: i heard you had some sort of a boat to travel tru teledahn
(11/24 21:31:53) Dusante: we'll find out some day
(11/24 21:31:55) Tweek: for other reasons Dirk
(11/24 21:32:23) Tweek: stained glass dus
(11/24 21:32:25) Douglas Sharper: I never have been able to figure that one out really.
(11/24 21:32:50) Tweek: so you ever thought of seeing Relto Doug?
(11/24 21:32:51) Douglas Sharper: I've seen most, if not all, of Teledahn. Been all over. Big place.
(11/24 21:33:02) Douglas Sharper: Relto, yes.
(11/24 21:33:12) Dusante: cooool, I like teledahn.
(11/24 21:33:24) Dusante: so many strange creature noises
(11/24 21:33:50) Douglas Sharper: Yes, fun place Teledahn.
(11/24 21:33:53) Dirk: it is indeed a beautifull age
(11/24 21:34:00) Tweek: not safe enough for the DRC I suppose..i'm surprised they havent tried to confiscate our books
(11/24 21:34:05) Dusante: I would hate to fall in the water though
