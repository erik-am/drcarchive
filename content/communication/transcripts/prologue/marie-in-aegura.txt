(12/08 12:01:11) Guildsman Drak: but where is the rest ofwe've only seen the top staff - there are other people in the DRC?
(12/08 12:01:25) Christoph05: I was going to say, that would possibly be an OSHA violation
(12/08 12:01:50) Strife: *cough*13*cough*
(12/08 12:02:01) teferi: OSHA, schmOSHA, if you had the opportunity to work extra on D'ni, wouldn't you?
(12/08 12:02:02) Marie Sutherland: We don't believe in OSHA down here. We just use cones! :)
(12/08 12:02:05) Christoph05: funny strife
(12/08 12:02:19) Guildsman Drak: don't tell OSHA that
(12/08 12:02:28) Christoph05: Nice idea Marie, cones can be broken just like OSHA rules
(12/08 12:02:34) Pa'lua: Yes, I'd like to keep the government and all it's agencies out of here.
(12/08 12:02:54) Christoph05: Anarchy eh, sounds like fun.
(12/08 12:02:59) Marie Sutherland: Well we need some structure - but certainly not much right now.
(12/08 12:03:14) teferi: there just aren't enough people here yet to make government seriously necessary
(12/08 12:03:27) Guildsman Drak: well - do we really know were all the DRC funding is comeing from?
(12/08 12:03:39) Strife: does the DRC plan on utilizing the raw materials of the outlying ages to fund or turn a profit?
(12/08 12:03:45) teferi: a good chunk of it is DRF money, I know that.
(12/08 12:04:09) Guildsman Drak: [DRF?]
(12/08 12:04:19) Dan'ni: D'ni Restoration Foundation
(12/08 12:04:23) Marie Sutherland: A foundation funds some of it. UbiSoft has funded some. It's been a fairly expensive operation.
(12/08 12:04:31) Marie Sutherland: Yes the DRF
(12/08 12:04:51) Knottyboy: shorah all
(12/08 12:04:59) an'nie: shorah

(12/08 12:05:53) Guildsman Drak: anyone know how Zandi is doing, he left his Airstreem and book (and chips) up there....
(12/08 12:06:02) Marie Sutherland: I do need to get back to work - I'm goin to look at the Great Zero today, and Gahreesen.

(12/08 12:09:43) Pa'lua: Yes, she spoke about the Great Zero.
