(12/26 13:01:11) Tehl Nava: just linked, what is that?
(12/26 13:01:25) Victor Laxman: he continues to disregard the warnings
(12/26 13:01:26) Brian Fioca: what do they see? are they up with you?
(12/26 13:01:41) phend: no - i am up - the guild hall
(12/26 13:02:00) Dr Kodama: Phil, we talked about this.
(12/26 13:02:25) From Kam Uraki: Wow the Bahro are chatty today

(12/26 13:02:32) phend: yes Dr. Kodama
(12/26 13:02:42) Dr Kodama: PHil, you must come down.
(12/26 13:02:55) phend: but my journey leads me here
(12/26 13:03:08) Brian Fioca: Phil, can we come there too?
(12/26 13:03:11) Lynx: It is a plesure to meet the DRC
(12/26 13:03:16) Victor Laxman: Phil, journey or no, we had an agreement.
(12/26 13:03:36) Dr Kodama: His "agreements" mean nothing.
(12/26 13:03:42) phend: you agreed - i said that my journey would continue
(12/26 13:04:04) phend: i don't mean to be any trouble - but i must be here
(12/26 13:04:12) Brian Fioca: Why can't he be there?
(12/26 13:04:20) Dr Kodama: Phil what you must do is come down.
(12/26 13:04:29) Brian Fioca: why?
(12/26 13:04:59) Victor Laxman: because it's not safe Mr. Fioca. How many times do we have to repeat those words?
(12/26 13:05:09) Dr Kodama: You people.
(12/26 13:05:13) Brian Fioca: why is it not safe?
(12/26 13:05:22) Dr Kodama: Because it's dangerous.
(12/26 13:05:26) phend: my journey is not always safe
(12/26 13:05:31) Kam Uraki: What's life without a little risk Dr.?
(12/26 13:06:03) Michael Engberg: They never listen to the warnings of the DRC...
(12/26 13:06:08) Brian Fioca: it's not safe because it's dangerous? that's not much of a n answer
(12/26 13:06:15) Victor Laxman: A little risk? I assure you we've progressed far beyond "little"
(12/26 13:06:16) Brian Fioca: you're not giving us good reasons
(12/26 13:06:23) Dr Kodama: Not much of an answer for a stupid question.
(12/26 13:06:34) Tehl Nava: People are more attracted things they're warned about...
(12/26 13:06:35) Brian Fioca: I see
(12/26 13:06:56) Dr Kodama: I see your jacket. I know your game Brian.
(12/26 13:07:02) phend: there is risk - but i follow them
(12/26 13:07:04) Brian Fioca: i like trees
(12/26 13:07:20) Brian Fioca: trees are safe, are they not?
(12/26 13:07:29) Jesse (Ich bin an der Oberfl채che, komme gleich zur체ck):
(12/26 13:07:30) Dr Kodama: Laxman, do you have any ideas?
(12/26 13:07:31) Jesse (Ich bin an der Oberfl채che, komme gleich zur체ck):
(12/26 13:07:36) Dr Kodama: Should we go up and get him?
(12/26 13:07:41) Brian Fioca: no
(12/26 13:07:46) Brian Fioca: not again
(12/26 13:07:47) Victor Laxman: Yes Tehl, and curiosity didn't treat the cat very well did it?
(12/26 13:07:56) Brian Fioca: leave him be
(12/26 13:08:01) Dr Kodama: Is your name Laxman Brian?
(12/26 13:08:17) Brian Fioca: stupid question
(12/26 13:08:32) phend: it is not safe here - i know why they are concerned
(12/26 13:08:42) Brian Fioca: why is it not safe, phil?
(12/26 13:08:55) phend: but i must be here
(12/26 13:09:00) Victor Laxman: We're not certain McBeorn, but we believe Phil is effecting this somehow
(12/26 13:09:13) Tehl Nava: the curious cat could not also be stopped...
(12/26 13:09:23) Isabeaux: Affecting what?
(12/26 13:09:35) Dr Kodama: What about the Nexus link? We can use it.
(12/26 13:09:44) Victor Laxman: There's no safe way to get up there Doctor
(12/26 13:09:51) phend: it was destroyed - so it is not stable - but it is part of something
(12/26 13:10:08) Brian Fioca: part of what
(12/26 13:10:16) Michael Engberg: I wouldn't use the nexus link, its just not safe.
(12/26 13:10:17) Dr Kodama: So we just leave him up there?
(12/26 13:10:26) Victor Laxman: That link is...not trustworthy
(12/26 13:10:27) Brian Fioca nods his head
(12/26 13:10:42) phend: part of my journey - part of knowing more
(12/26 13:10:44) UniqueHorn cheers
(12/26 13:10:48) Tehl Nava: as was said, what's life without risk?
(12/26 13:10:59) Brian Fioca: when will it be part of our journey?
(12/26 13:11:42) Dr Kodama: Where do you draw the line of risk?
(12/26 13:11:47) phend: yes - they are here
(12/26 13:11:59) Victor Laxman: Tehl you don't know what you're wishing for.
(12/26 13:12:15) Dr Kodama: As much as you disagree with our standards, up there is crossing the line.
(12/26 13:12:38) Brian Fioca: well i look forward to crossing it then
(12/26 13:13:04) Tehl Nava: I draw the line at death, no less... where do you draw it?
(12/26 13:13:19) Dr Kodama: As far as I know, none of you have been there and therefore your judgement on its safety is of no value. I draw it in the same place.
(12/26 13:13:40) Brian Fioca: phil is there
(12/26 13:13:48) phend: higher, yes - they are above
(12/26 13:13:52) Brian Fioca: he believes it to be important
(12/26 13:13:54) Dr Kodama: And that is easy for you to say Tehl.
(12/26 13:14:06) Victor Laxman: Phil please stop
(12/26 13:14:13) Dr Kodama: Phil, you must not do this.
(12/26 13:14:14) Tehl Nava: perhaps it is...
(12/26 13:14:15) Michael Engberg: phil, please return to the courtyard,
(12/26 13:14:20) phend: just higher - i can go just higher
(12/26 13:14:22) Victor Laxman: you can't trust..that palce
