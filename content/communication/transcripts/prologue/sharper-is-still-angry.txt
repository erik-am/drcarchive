(12/16 19:03:28) Christoph05: Hi douglas
(12/16 19:03:35) Katherian: Hiya Douglas.
(12/16 19:03:38) Katherian waves
(12/16 19:03:51) Douglas Sharper: reply
(12/16 19:03:53) Atelos: Hi Sharper
(12/16 19:03:57) Will Price: We're well. We were actually discussing the DRC situation earlier. We're very unimpressed.
(12/16 19:04:24) Douglas Sharper: I think this deserves more than unimpressed. This is downright pitiful.
(12/16 19:04:28) Douglas Sharper: And wrong.
(12/16 19:04:32) Douglas Sharper: We should be angry.
(12/16 19:04:32) Katherian: What is?
(12/16 19:04:35) Will Price: Forgive the understatement.
(12/16 19:04:37) Katherian: Oh the DRC situation...
(12/16 19:04:47) Katherian: [switches mental gears]
(12/16 19:04:52) Katherian: No, it's criminal.
(12/16 19:05:04) Douglas Sharper: Yes it is. Criminal.
(12/16 19:05:08) Jaharen: where is that music coming from?
(12/16 19:05:10) Christoph05: Do you know why Phill wouldn't listen to you Douglas?
(12/16 19:05:10) Katherian: I don't know who they think they're impressing, precisely, with the total information blackout.
(12/16 19:05:24) Christoph05: That is the lights changing
(12/16 19:05:25) Douglas Sharper: He likes to trust people.
(12/16 19:05:30) Douglas Sharper: I'm sure he trusted them.
(12/16 19:05:30) Jaharen: oh. got it
(12/16 19:05:39) Underwaterfall waves
(12/16 19:05:45) Katherian: Hi Under.
(12/16 19:07:12) Will Price: I've heard rumor that you'd like us to wear Yeesha's shirt in protest, Doug.
(12/16 19:07:12) Katherian: We've been sitting here talking about all of this, Douglas.
(12/16 19:07:13) Katherian: What the situation is...
(12/16 19:07:13) Katherian: What can be done...
(12/16 19:07:13) Douglas Sharper: I'm almost there.
(12/16 19:07:14) Katherian shrugs
(12/16 19:07:15) Douglas Sharper: I'm planning two quick things.
(12/16 19:07:17) Christoph05: speak freely douglas
(12/16 19:07:17) Loriendil: Will you share them?
(12/16 19:07:19) Douglas Sharper: Leading a group to tear down the barrier in front of the Kahlo pub
(12/16 19:07:20) Katherian: (And fears that a storm is brewing)
(12/16 19:07:21) Douglas Sharper: Opening up the private rooms in my own neighborhood.
(12/16 19:07:21) Douglas Sharper: And proving they are safe.
(12/16 19:07:23) Atelos: about your neighborhood
(12/16 19:07:23) Katherian: O
(12/16 19:07:24) Katherian: I'm all for that.
(12/16 19:07:24) Douglas Sharper: I'll need people for both.
(12/16 19:07:25) Katherian nods her head
(12/16 19:07:25) Atelos: how are you keeping it from the DRC if you are?
(12/16 19:07:27) iceburn: *grabs torch and pitchfork
(12/16 19:07:27) Christoph05: I'm in for the hood! and I need a good stiff drink!
(12/16 19:07:28) Atelos: they have access to the Nexus after all
(12/16 19:07:29) Underwaterfall: Wow. Indeed. I volunteer.
(12/16 19:07:29) Katherian: heh. now now, iceburn. relax.
(12/16 19:07:31) Atelos: and their the ones who programmed it to display in english
(12/16 19:07:31) Douglas Sharper: That's why we need people on our side. I'm sure they will try to "discipline" me
(12/16 19:07:36) Douglas Sharper: But I'm willing to stand up to them.
(12/16 19:07:47) Katherian: I'll go with you, Douglas.
(12/16 19:07:50) Katherian: For what it's worth.
(12/16 19:07:51) Katherian shrugs
(12/16 19:07:51) Christoph05: They tried to come after you didn't they Douglas?
(12/16 19:07:52) Underwaterfall nods his head
(12/16 19:07:57) Douglas Sharper: Hopefully people will come to my side if someting happens to me, like I'm trying to rally around Phil.
(12/16 19:08:05) Atelos: I'm in
(12/16 19:08:11) Jaharen: i'm game
(12/16 19:08:11) Atelos: tearing down barricades souns like fun
(12/16 19:08:15) Will Price: Do you have any thoughts about your plan after Phil is, hopefully, rescued?
(12/16 19:08:19) Katherian: But how do you propose, exactly, to accomplish what you are trying to do?
(12/16 19:08:23) Douglas Sharper: I just can't stand by and let them do this to Phil.
(12/16 19:08:24) Katherian: We have no crowbars...
(12/16 19:08:28) iceburn: *picks up pitchfork again
(12/16 19:08:35) Underwaterfall: Doug...Just say when.
(12/16 19:08:46) Christoph05: can we do it tonight??
(12/16 19:08:56) Douglas Sharper: You are all encouraging.
(12/16 19:08:58) Douglas Sharper: Thanks.
(12/16 19:09:06) Douglas Sharper: I still need to work out some issues.
(12/16 19:09:14) Katherian: Heh...well you missed the 2-hour chat we were having about this. Wink
(12/16 19:09:15) Katherian laughs
(12/16 19:09:25) Katherian: Where I was told repeatedly to relax. Wink
(12/16 19:09:27) Douglas Sharper: I don't think tonight will work.
(12/16 19:09:32) Atelos nods his head
(12/16 19:09:34) Jaharen: katherian's got a point about how to do all this
(12/16 19:09:40) Christoph05: That is ok then, there is always tomorrow!
(12/16 19:09:41) Douglas Sharper: Who told you to relax? Tweek?
(12/16 19:09:52) Katherian: Not naming names... <smile>
(12/16 19:09:58) Douglas Sharper: He's the one I've been hearing from. Peace this and peace that. I'm for D'ni.
(12/16 19:10:01) Katherian: I tend to be a "go-getter".
(12/16 19:10:08) Douglas Sharper: Please.
(12/16 19:10:08) Katherian shrugs
(12/16 19:10:09) Christoph05: Same here Kath
(12/16 19:10:12) Underwaterfall: Can you hazard a guess - tomorrow, or Thursay?
(12/16 19:10:17) Douglas Sharper: If you are for D'ni, you are against the DRC!
(12/16 19:10:21) Katherian: And I call things like they are...and usually lose friends in the process. heh.
(12/16 19:10:28) Will Price: Doug...
(12/16 19:10:51) Katherian: I don't think those things are necessarily related, Douglas.
(12/16 19:10:53) Douglas Sharper: By Thurs. we will be in the pub.
(12/16 19:11:03) Will Price: Can you pass on any information that we can use to back up your claim against the DRC? It's hard to convince people... some peole.
(12/16 19:11:06) Christoph05: Here Here!!
(12/16 19:11:12) Douglas Sharper: And I hope by tomorrow to be in my private rooms in my hood.
(12/16 19:11:27) Will Price: *people
(12/16 19:11:27) Katherian nods her head
(12/16 19:11:29) Douglas Sharper: What is my claim? I don't understand what needs to be backed up!
(12/16 19:11:29) Christoph05: I will be down here ready to help Douglas
(12/16 19:11:37) Douglas Sharper: They took a man against his will yesterday.
(12/16 19:11:40) Underwaterfall: Will..THey kidnapped Phil. Forcibly.
(12/16 19:11:46) Douglas Sharper: They are not telling anyone why or where.
(12/16 19:11:55) Christoph05: I think they need to know why if we are for D'ni we are against DRC
(12/16 19:11:59) Katherian: Douglas...can you define "They"?
(12/16 19:12:02) Douglas Sharper: They do not open areas that are safe for all of us.
(12/16 19:12:06) Will Price: I know. It is still hard to convince people, though. That's why I ask.
(12/16 19:12:18) Douglas Sharper: Laxman and Watson took Phil. I was there.
(12/16 19:12:21) Katherian: k.
(12/16 19:12:22) Katherian nods her head
(12/16 19:12:25) Christoph05: Good move at the jump of faith Douglas
(12/16 19:12:39) Atelos: Some of those who are still trying to defend the DRC are saying Phil was acting oddly, which he was, and saying the DRC took him for his own good, because he was mentally ill
(12/16 19:12:40) Underwaterfall: Phil apparently has no legal recourse or official refuge down here. We, then must help. Or do you want to be taken?
(12/16 19:12:58) Underwaterfall: Frightened me a bit.
(12/16 19:13:05) Katherian: That's all rather black & white isn't it?
(12/16 19:13:11) Douglas Sharper: Well the second the DRC says one of us is acting "oddly" I guess no one will come to our defense when we are removed then either?
(12/16 19:13:12) Atelos: I don't beleive them, but its hard to argue against with what little we know
(12/16 19:13:13) Katherian: [Looks concerned]
(12/16 19:13:19) Underwaterfall: Mentally ill?
(12/16 19:13:24) Douglas Sharper: Idiots who argue that are the same people who allow evil dictators power.
(12/16 19:13:34) Douglas Sharper: Ridiculous.
(12/16 19:13:36) Will Price: True enough.
(12/16 19:13:39) Douglas Sharper: People don't think anymore.
(12/16 19:13:41) Elspeth: I'd say idiots who follow orders, actually.
(12/16 19:13:58) Katherian: This is true, Douglas.
(12/16 19:13:59) Katherian nods her head
(12/16 19:14:01) Underwaterfall nods his head
(12/16 19:14:01) Atelos nods his head
(12/16 19:14:02) Will Price: The DRCs actions are enough for me to help Phil.
(12/16 19:14:14) Douglas Sharper: Regardless, there are more of us every day. We will go on with or without them.
(12/16 19:14:37) Katherian: It would be dandy, however, if Yeesha would poke her head in... <grumbles>
(12/16 19:14:43) SeanPH: whate are we talking about here doug
(12/16 19:14:44) Douglas Sharper: Evenso, we must try to convince others of the dangers that our current path is leading us.
(12/16 19:14:55) Elspeth: wouldn't it just. But I think she means us to make our own way for a time.
(12/16 19:14:55) Douglas Sharper: The DRC is everything Yeesha talked about.
(12/16 19:14:56) Will Price: Douglass... what are your thoughts about Laxman's control over the KI system?
(12/16 19:14:57) Douglas Sharper: Pride.
(12/16 19:15:06) Douglas Sharper: No care for the little people.
(12/16 19:15:28) Christoph05: Did I see that Marie actually has gone to a hood?
(12/16 19:15:29) Douglas Sharper: I will tell you something.
(12/16 19:15:39) Katherian: And do you share my concern for the fact that they're irresponsibly getting ready to activate tech they don't understand? (The great zero, namely)
(12/16 19:15:43) Douglas Sharper: The DRC needs us here whether they admit it or not.
(12/16 19:15:50) Douglas Sharper: They have the power to shut down the nexus but I don't think they would do it.
(12/16 19:16:09) Douglas Sharper: The Great Zero is coming soon.
(12/16 19:16:13) Douglas Sharper: I've been there.
(12/16 19:16:16) Elspeth: Do they understand the Nexus well enough to allow themselves, and close it to others via KI identification?
(12/16 19:16:26) Douglas Sharper: It's not working but they need help to get it working.
(12/16 19:16:27) Elspeth: Or are we safe on that for a while?
(12/16 19:16:33) Douglas Sharper: They'll use that to gain "fans"
(12/16 19:16:35) Underwaterfall: I realise you can't just act with no plan, but can you guess Mid-day..or later tomorrow / Thursday. When should I / we be here?
(12/16 19:16:37) Will Price: Should we help them get it working?
(12/16 19:16:39) Douglas Sharper: Laxman has already tried.
(12/16 19:16:51) Katherian: I.e. - Can they segregate people using the KI's?
(12/16 19:16:51) Elspeth: What does the Great Zero do? Is starting it a good thing or a bad thing?
(12/16 19:16:56) Douglas Sharper: I will spread the word when it's going to happen.
(12/16 19:16:59) Douglas Sharper: At least I will try.
(12/16 19:17:02) Elspeth: Or just a reward for their fans?
(12/16 19:17:05) Douglas Sharper: But of course not everyone will be able to go.
(12/16 19:17:14) Douglas Sharper: The DRC limits the number of people in the city.
(12/16 19:17:20) Christoph05: I will help spread the word with you Douglas, I will be here to help as much as possible
(12/16 19:17:20) Douglas Sharper: Yet another thing!
(12/16 19:17:36) Douglas Sharper: Thank you.
(12/16 19:17:46) Katherian: Yah. 30 at a time?? I mean come on...who decided this arbitrary number??
(12/16 19:17:48) Underwaterfall: I will do whatever I can.
(12/16 19:17:53) Jaharen: the city is deserted late at night...
(12/16 19:18:02) Douglas Sharper: Hmmm
(12/16 19:18:03) Christoph05: I would be wearing the shirt if I didn't have a shift tonight
(12/16 19:18:09) Douglas Sharper: Late when?
(12/16 19:18:13) Katherian: Yah, I do my barricade hopping in the middle of the night, Jaharen. Wink hehe
(12/16 19:18:25) Will Price: Beware, Douglas, those who still like the DRC have heard something's up.
(12/16 19:18:49) Jaharen: pacific time, around 1:00 am is when the crowd gets smaller
(12/16 19:18:49) Katherian: Like around 1am - 3am PST, Douglas.
(12/16 19:18:51) Will Price: They may leak information.
(12/16 19:18:53) Arnium: Up? what is up?
(12/16 19:19:06) Elspeth: Mr. Sharper, excuse me -- I haven't been here long -- do you think we should help or hinder the restoration of the Great Zero? Or does it matter>?
(12/16 19:19:28) Christoph05: We can probably finish the restoration without the DRC
(12/16 19:19:38) SeanPH: hmm
(12/16 19:19:47) Douglas Sharper: Let's wait and see what they ask for.
(12/16 19:19:48) Katherian: I, for one, am going to be OUT of the cavern when they fire that thing up. :-\
(12/16 19:19:49) SeanPH: careful people, the walls have ears
(12/16 19:20:16) Katherian: I'm thinking it'll be sunroof time when they fire up the ol' Zero.
(12/16 19:20:17) Douglas Sharper: Not a bad idea though. Not helping them with the zero.
(12/16 19:20:54) Katherian: Well for prudence sake...
(12/16 19:20:58) Katherian: I think some of us SHOULD help them...
(12/16 19:20:58) Douglas Sharper: I need to go visit more people.
(12/16 19:20:59) John Lynch: I'm doubtful they really need our help. I'm sure they could do it alone with their Resengs.
(12/16 19:21:07) Katherian: OTHERWISE we're gonna have no CLUE what's going on with it!
(12/16 19:21:08) SeanPH: if it goes wrong we can say we "we told ya so", if it goes right we were protesting what happened to phil
(12/16 19:21:09) Douglas Sharper: Remember how you feel now!
(12/16 19:21:22) Navra: Can we deter them by staying out of the city?
(12/16 19:21:35) Douglas Sharper: The DRC will try to convince us of other things.
(12/16 19:21:36) Katherian: Navra: They WANT us out of the city, hon.
(12/16 19:21:53) Douglas Sharper: We will go the city soon! The Pub will be open again!
(12/16 19:22:18) SeanPH cheers
(12/16 19:22:18) Elspeth: There he goes again. The Running Man...
(12/16 19:22:19) Underwaterfall claps his hands
(12/16 19:22:20) John Lynch: A sit in could be performed in blocked off areas....
(12/16 19:22:21) Elspeth: Heyyy, how did you do that?
(12/16 19:22:25) Elspeth cheers
(12/16 19:22:25) Katherian: yes, he pinballed off that column there.
(12/16 19:22:28) Katherian points
(12/16 19:22:32) Douglas Sharper: Wear the Yeesha shirt. We need to know who is on our side.
