(12/02 17:46:13) The World: and I'm sure we all do.

(12/02 17:46:27) The World: yes, Zandi. have you met Zandi?
(12/02 17:46:29) phend: I don't know zandi yet

(12/02 17:47:37) phend: Of course I know the DRC members
(12/02 17:48:09) Tweek: hmm troubling times ahead with the DRC,
(12/02 17:48:41) Tweek: we are going to all need to get on if the restoration is going to be a success..many people dont realise this
(12/02 17:48:45) The World: what about Sharper, what do you make of him and his ambitions?
(12/02 17:48:48) phend: maybe
(12/02 17:49:20) phend: i met him
(12/02 17:49:35) Tweek: he was in the Uru Obsession hood earlier TW
(12/02 17:49:47) The World: I know, heh. I was just asking what he thought of him.
(12/02 17:49:48) phend: he was kind to me I think
(12/02 17:49:51) phend: no earlier
(12/02 17:49:56) Tweek: ah
(12/02 17:50:03) phend: when I came back from Eder Kemo
(12/02 17:50:13) Shawnzy: I take it you have been led by Yeesha, Phil?
(12/02 17:50:27) phend: have you, too?
(12/02 17:50:33) Shawnzy: Yes.
(12/02 17:50:41) phend: yes
(12/02 17:50:41) Shawnzy: I think most of us have.
(12/02 17:50:48) Tweek: no..Yeesha showed me a path..it was my choice to take it
(12/02 17:51:06) phend: that is a good way Tweek
(12/02 17:51:10) The World: very true. we all have the power to shape our journeys.
(12/02 17:51:23) Shawnzy: I agree Tweek
(12/02 17:51:39) phend: some things are predestined, but our choice is not
(12/02 17:52:01) Kirsehn: what choice phil?
(12/02 17:52:20) phend: our choices
(12/02 17:52:24) Shawnzy: Have you seen predestined things?
(12/02 17:52:25) Tweek: I like the Beginnig and destination are set..its what you do on the journey that makes it worthwhile
(12/02 17:52:37) phend: yes, have you?
(12/02 17:52:41) Tweek: please excuse my typo's
(12/02 17:53:19) Shawnzy: I suppose I still have a great deal of learning to do.  I guess I don't see all that you do Phil.
(12/02 17:53:29) Kirsehn: Phil...the page you left in the UO hood is gone...did the DRC take it?
(12/02 17:53:35) Kirsehn: or did Yeesha take it?
(12/02 17:53:43) phend: The predestined things are laid ahead of us
(12/02 17:53:47) Tweek: I see coincidences...usually when I see coincidence I see something higher at work
(12/02 17:53:58) phend: and we choose from them
(12/02 17:54:04) phend: yes tweek
(12/02 17:54:11) Jensen: will you sign my cone?
(12/02 17:54:24) Shawnzy: lol, Jensen
(12/02 17:54:32) phend: coincidence is sometime just coincidence...
(12/02 17:54:38) From Tweek: lol
(12/02 17:54:42) phend: and sometimes it is the maker
(12/02 17:54:47) Tweek: thats true Phil
(12/02 17:55:10) Kirsehn: yes very true
(12/02 17:55:11) phend: what else have you learned tweek?

(12/02 17:56:18) Kirsehn: mine as well
(12/02 17:56:29) phend: have you learned of the restoration?
(12/02 17:56:35) Kirsehn: they were not as wonderful as they i thought they always were
(12/02 17:56:43) Kirsehn: there was corruption
(12/02 17:56:47) Shawnzy: I've learned many different views of the restoration.
(12/02 17:56:51) phend: yes?
(12/02 17:56:56) Tweek: The restoration seems a complaex thing to me..there are many views and parties involved
(12/02 17:57:02) phend: yes
(12/02 17:57:07) Tweek: people have their own agenda's they work to
(12/02 17:57:14) Kirsehn: the DRC wants safety first....but they also seem to hide things from us
(12/02 17:57:33) phend: Kirsehn and Tweek have learned some of the things I have learned
(12/02 17:57:38) Kirsehn: Sharper disagrees and feels we should be given more access
(12/02 17:57:46) Tweek: I do not know what the DRC feel about The Least
(12/02 17:57:58) Kirsehn: i would love to hear from Yeesha again
(12/02 17:58:19) Shawnzy: You have heard the Bahro in D'ni... have you not?
(12/02 17:58:29) phend: yes
(12/02 17:58:29) Ahnochai: indeed, i wonder where she is?
(12/02 17:58:43) phend: she knows

(12/02 17:59:52) Shawnzy: We want to learn all that we can.  And you are always welcome.
(12/02 18:00:00) Tweek: in my neck of the woods it would be about 2am..I shall blame my spelling mistakes on tiredness
(12/02 18:00:03) Kirsehn: yes :)

(12/02 18:00:19) phend: I have to continue my journey - you have to sleep!
(12/02 18:00:20) Kirsehn: *dittoes Shawnzy*
(12/02 18:00:25) Mr. Lag: Is Yeesha using the DRC?
(12/02 18:00:29) Tweek: I hope to see if my theories on Yeesha are correct
(12/02 18:00:29) To Quintin in akira's Relto: yes
