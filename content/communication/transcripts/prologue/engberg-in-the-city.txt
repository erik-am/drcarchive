(12/01 15:54:45) Pepsi: Are you letting in more explorers today or tomorrow?
(12/01 15:54:45) Michael Engberg: Sharper, has never been DRC or ever will be.
(12/01 15:54:52) GoffyOne: sharper is hunting shromes or something now
(12/01 15:55:12) Tink: That's kind of why Tink asks you guys about him . . .
(12/01 15:55:13) Michael Engberg: thats  my thinking.
(12/01 15:55:42) Tink: Are The Least aware of Sharper?
(12/01 15:55:44) Pepsi: Many more?
(12/01 15:55:50) Tah: Will the drc be making some announced visits?
(12/01 15:55:56) Michael Engberg:  Hunting shroomies. I keep hearing this rumor.
(12/01 15:56:22) Knottyboy: I've tried to lure her to shore, is that wise?
(12/01 15:56:27) Tink: Has DRC made a count of the Shroomies?
(12/01 15:56:33) Michael Engberg: I wish I had some proof
(12/01 15:56:42) Knottyboy: I've got pictures
(12/01 15:56:42) GoffyOne: or perhaps he is gathering some moshroms for the pub opening
(12/01 15:56:46) Tink: Put a camera there?
(12/01 15:56:48) oclee: proof of what?

(12/01 15:57:11) Michael Engberg:  Tink, no time.
(12/01 15:57:19) GoffyOne: I think sharper would notice it
(12/01 15:57:28) GoffyOne: and perhaps disable them
(12/01 15:57:28) Tink: Somedat then?
(12/01 15:57:38) Tink: Ummm "someday" then?
