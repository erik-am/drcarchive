(12/18 13:42:55) Douglas Sharper: Hello
(12/18 13:43:02) Nelson: What brings you here?
(12/18 13:43:13) Douglas Sharper: I'm not sure.
(12/18 13:43:18) KnitCucmber: Shorah Douglas. You're not invisible this time. :)
(12/18 13:43:31) an'nie: Any news?
(12/18 13:43:48) Douglas Sharper: No. Have you heard any?
(12/18 13:43:51) Kyrah: So here is the famous Douglas...
(12/18 13:43:56) Douglas Sharper: I heard from someone that Dr. Watson was around earlier.
(12/18 13:44:05) Douglas Sharper: Curious as to what he had to say.
(12/18 13:44:07) an'nie: No Just Rand and Watson have been to some hoods
(12/18 13:44:07) KnitCucmber: I heard that he and Rand were both there.
(12/18 13:44:11) Nelson: He was, talking about how taking Phil away was for his own good
(12/18 13:44:21) Douglas Sharper: That's funny
(12/18 13:44:22) an'nie: Just that Phil was being well taken care of
(12/18 13:44:27) Nelson: But that it wasn't for the sake of us, the explorers
(12/18 13:44:28) Douglas Sharper: Of course.
(12/18 13:44:38) Douglas Sharper: What else would the good Dr. say.
(12/18 13:44:44) Nelson: I don't know
(12/18 13:45:01) Douglas Sharper: Poor Dr. Watson.
(12/18 13:45:06) Nelson: So you haven't heard anything from Phil?
(12/18 13:45:08) an'nie: How goes the plan with your hood douglas?
(12/18 13:45:09) Douglas Sharper: I feel bad for him really.
(12/18 13:45:22) Cycreim: Oh, hello Doug.
(12/18 13:45:24) Douglas Sharper: Still working on it. Having some trouble with the doors.
(12/18 13:45:26) Nelson: Understandably, they took his Relto book and KI
(12/18 13:45:28) an'nie: Poor watson???
(12/18 13:45:35) KnitCucmber: Need a little elbow grease? :)
(12/18 13:45:40) Douglas Sharper: Yeah Poor Watson, he's in over his head.
(12/18 13:45:50) Nelson: Oh, I thought you meant Phil
(12/18 13:45:51) Douglas Sharper: More than elbow grease.
(12/18 13:45:54) an'nie: hope he figures it out
(12/18 13:46:01) Nelson: What do you mean that Dr. Watson is in over his head?
(12/18 13:46:03) KnitCucmber: Monkey wrench? :)
(12/18 13:46:21) KnitCucmber: Dead weight to throw at the door?
(12/18 13:46:26) Douglas Sharper: It's too much for him. He's not meant to be a governor.
(12/18 13:46:37) Douglas Sharper: He's a field director for digs.
(12/18 13:46:39) KnitCucmber: Is that was he's being set up as?
(12/18 13:46:41) Douglas Sharper: Basically.
(12/18 13:46:42) Nelson: I hadn't realized he had become a governor.
(12/18 13:46:47) Nelson: Madness.
(12/18 13:46:52) Douglas Sharper: He can't lead thousands of people.
(12/18 13:46:56) Nelson: If not him though, who should be in charge?
(12/18 13:46:57) Douglas Sharper: Nor does he want to, I'm sure.
(12/18 13:47:04) Cycreim: What's the news on Phil, anyway? I've heard all sorts of crazy stories.
(12/18 13:47:05) KnitCucmber: I thought Engberg was going for ruler.
(12/18 13:47:29) Douglas Sharper: I haven't heard anything from Phil. Supposedly they are goign to let someone go see him?
(12/18 13:47:36) KnitCucmber: I think that is Rand.
(12/18 13:47:36) Nelson: I hadn't heard that!
(12/18 13:47:40) an'nie: yea right....
(12/18 13:47:49) an'nie: Hard to believe
(12/18 13:47:52) Cycreim: I still think they should just let him go.
(12/18 13:48:04) KnitCucmber: Wonder if he's in a white coat?
(12/18 13:48:07) Cycreim: It just ain't right.
(12/18 13:48:09) Nelson: What could they be doing that's good if it requires kidnapping him?
(12/18 13:48:25) an'nie: anything we can do to help???
(12/18 13:48:29) Douglas Sharper: I just hope they let him out soon.
(12/18 13:48:35) KnitCucmber: As do we all. :)
(12/18 13:48:42) Nelson: Wasn't the opening of the Pub meant to help?
(12/18 13:49:00) KnitCucmber: I haven't been able to get into the city yet to see the pub. :(
(12/18 13:49:05) Douglas Sharper: The opening of the pub is only a taste of what is possible.
(12/18 13:49:12) KnitCucmber: Been playing with the pumpkins in my hood.
(12/18 13:49:16) Cycreim: Um, no offense, but I think the pub thing was a bit... uh, too much.
(12/18 13:49:16) Douglas Sharper: We'll see how the DRC reacts.
(12/18 13:49:19) Nelson: So it wasn't directly related to taking Phil?
(12/18 13:49:24) Douglas Sharper: Too much?
(12/18 13:49:29) an'nie: Do you think it is possible to break more barriers with enough people
(12/18 13:49:43) KnitCucmber: Either that, or we'll all freeze in one place. ;)
(12/18 13:49:43) Nelson: Well, we removed their barriers. Jmping them is one thing, destroying another
(12/18 13:49:44) Cycreim: Yeah. I mean, all that's going to end up happening is that they're going to close up more areas.
(12/18 13:49:54) Douglas Sharper: They haven't yet have they?
(12/18 13:50:01) Nelson: Not yet, that we've seen
(12/18 13:50:04) Cycreim: Well, no...
(12/18 13:50:11) Brian Fioca: hello Douglas
(12/18 13:50:15) Cycreim: They haven't exactly told us anything about Phil yet either.
(12/18 13:50:16) Tah: hello brain
(12/18 13:50:17) KnitCucmber: Brian! :)
(12/18 13:50:19) Tah: er brian
(12/18 13:50:20) Douglas Sharper: Well then why do you worry? You give them too much credit.
(12/18 13:50:25) Douglas Sharper: Hi Brian .
(12/18 13:50:33) Cycreim: Oh, hello Brian.
(12/18 13:50:34) Douglas Sharper: How are things?
(12/18 13:50:38) Brian Fioca: good
(12/18 13:50:39) KnitCucmber: *waves at Brian Fioca*
(12/18 13:50:50) KnitCucmber: I keep typing Brain.
(12/18 13:50:54) Nelson: I don't know, it seems like even though progress may be slow, they are acting in our best interests, or at least not against them
(12/18 13:50:55) Brian Fioca: how is the work you're doing on the neighborhood
(12/18 13:51:02) Cycreim: Well, I may not quite trust them the way I used to, but I still think they have some sort of dignity.
(12/18 13:51:16) Douglas Sharper: No one said they had no dignity.
(12/18 13:51:18) an'nie: Why do you say that Nelson??
(12/18 13:51:27) Cycreim: Decency too.
(12/18 13:51:43) Nelson: Well, they haven't taken our Relto books or anything important and nothing that they aren't giving us is critical
(12/18 13:51:47) KnitCucmber: I can't think of anything to say. I finally run into Douglas and I can't think of anything to say!!!! Argh!
(12/18 13:51:52) an'nie: Its not decent to grab people and hold them hostage
(12/18 13:51:55) Douglas Sharper: They can't take your Relto book!
(12/18 13:52:03) Nelson: They took Phil's
(12/18 13:52:12) Tah: I can, Douglas what impressed you most about your journeys
(12/18 13:52:14) an'nie: they took my closet maybe...big deal
(12/18 13:52:17) Douglas Sharper: He was too trustworthy.
(12/18 13:52:20) KnitCucmber: As long as they don't take my blue hair I'll be okay.
(12/18 13:52:30) Cycreim: Heh.
(12/18 13:52:42) Brian Fioca: yeah, he should've ran from them
(12/18 13:52:51) Brian Fioca: is he ok?
(12/18 13:52:54) Cycreim: It's too late now, Brian.
(12/18 13:52:55) Nelson: You keep on mentioning this other 'hood, Douglas. Is it K'veer?
(12/18 13:52:56) Brian Fioca: any word?
(12/18 13:52:58) an'nie: he was just too slow
(12/18 13:53:17) Tah: IF you believe in the words of yeesha, and so does phil
(12/18 13:53:26) Tah: he must have gone by choice
(12/18 13:53:32) Douglas Sharper: No, no. It's a hood like any other. I'm just trying to get my private room doors open.
(12/18 13:53:35) an'nie: no
(12/18 13:53:39) Douglas Sharper: As I know it's safe in there.
(12/18 13:53:45) Douglas Sharper: Another thing I'd like to prove.
(12/18 13:53:47) Nelson: When you figure out how, will you share with us?
(12/18 13:53:53) an'nie: wish we could open our doors too
(12/18 13:54:02) KnitCucmber: I just want my colored firemarbles back. :)
(12/18 13:54:08) Brian Fioca: so, what do you think they are hiding with this ruse of safety?
(12/18 13:54:09) an'nie: we have tried alot of things
(12/18 13:54:18) Brian Fioca: there are a lot of theories
(12/18 13:54:28) Douglas Sharper: I don't understand it.
(12/18 13:54:34) Nelson: D'ni corpses?
(12/18 13:54:34) Douglas Sharper: I have a lot of my own theories.
(12/18 13:54:39) Douglas Sharper: Ha!
(12/18 13:54:46) Brian Fioca laughs
(12/18 13:54:48) KnitCucmber: Good for jumping on. ;)
(12/18 13:54:53) Nelson: That would be a no then...
(12/18 13:54:54) KnitCucmber: Just like Kadish.
(12/18 13:55:01) Nelson: A little morbid for my tastes
(12/18 13:55:06) KnitCucmber: *bounce, bounce, bounce*
(12/18 13:55:18) Brian Fioca: who knows
(12/18 13:55:22) Cycreim: I wouldn't put it past them though.
(12/18 13:55:30) an'nie: if 30 some people crashed the barrier in the city why not here
(12/18 13:55:34) Douglas Sharper: There are no corpses.
(12/18 13:55:38) Tah: you are awfully quiet fouglas
(12/18 13:55:41) Cycreim: Oh well, until we get enough evidence, we won't be able to tell anything that's going on.
(12/18 13:55:42) Tah: douglas
(12/18 13:55:45) Douglas Sharper: I'm thinking.
(12/18 13:55:49) Nelson: Well, that's good. How do you know though without having opened teh doors?
(12/18 13:55:52) Cycreim: Well, maybe not anything, but you know.
(12/18 13:56:13) Brian Fioca: the DRC have been strangely quiet about the pub incident
(12/18 13:56:16) Brian Fioca: do they know?
(12/18 13:56:21) Douglas Sharper: Strangely.
(12/18 13:56:34) Nelson: I don't see how they couldn't know with all the traffic in the city
(12/18 13:56:37) Douglas Sharper: I'm not sure what they are up to. Maybe too busy questioning Phil.
(12/18 13:56:40) Brian Fioca: maybe they are in retreat
(12/18 13:56:49) Cycreim: They've been strangely quiet about everything.
(12/18 13:56:49) Nelson: Questioning can't take all of them though
(12/18 13:56:55) KnitCucmber: Maybe they're having too much trouble linking around, like we are. Probably stuck somewhere.
(12/18 13:56:58) Douglas Sharper: Sure it can.
(12/18 13:57:12) Cycreim: I haven't heard a peep out of them since they turned on the fans.
(12/18 13:57:15) Douglas Sharper: They want to know everything.
(12/18 13:57:16) an'nie: maybe they think they are placating us
(12/18 13:57:20) KnitCucmber: Hi Tweek! :)
(12/18 13:57:24) Katherian: Yah I expected there to be some kind of reaction last night on the DRC website.
(12/18 13:57:28) Katherian: And there was NOTHING.
(12/18 13:57:34) Katherian: Hasn't been anything for days in fact.
(12/18 13:57:40) Nelson: They should let us explor for them if they want to know everything
(12/18 13:57:45) Douglas Sharper: That has been there MO lately.
(12/18 13:57:51) Brian Fioca: well, they realize they can't keep us corraled
(12/18 13:57:52) Douglas Sharper: Keep quiet.
(12/18 13:57:52) Nelson: There are enough of us that we can get it done much faster
(12/18 13:57:55) KnitCucmber: Silent, but deadly.
(12/18 13:57:55) Douglas Sharper: Say Nothing.
(12/18 13:58:07) Cycreim: I think we all want to knowas much as we can.
(12/18 13:58:09) Katherian nods her head
(12/18 13:58:12) Douglas Sharper: Better than Engberg spouting off at least.
(12/18 13:58:17) Brian Fioca: yes
(12/18 13:58:21) Brian Fioca: he's been known to do that
(12/18 13:58:24) Cycreim: How dull.
(12/18 13:58:24) Douglas Sharper: Tweek is here - leader of the free people.
(12/18 13:58:26) Tah: douglas if we are to be quiet what should we then be doing
(12/18 13:58:34) Katherian: Why is it we've heard very little from Marie?
(12/18 13:58:39) an'nie: Hey Tweek
(12/18 13:58:40) KnitCucmber: Tweekikens. :)
(12/18 13:58:41) Brian Fioca: no, tah, the DRC has been quiet
(12/18 13:58:48) Nelson: Has anyone had an actual conversation with her?
(12/18 13:58:53) Tah: yes they have
(12/18 13:58:55) Douglas Sharper: We have heard very little from any of them.
(12/18 13:59:00) Tweek: No Doug ...Im selling them for $2.50
(12/18 13:59:01) Cycreim: Hiya, Tweek.
(12/18 13:59:10) KnitCucmber: LOL!
(12/18 13:59:11) Katherian: Heh. <thumps Tweek>
(12/18 13:59:11) Douglas Sharper: How goes the crusade Tweek?
(12/18 13:59:11) Tah: I would still like to know what action plans everyone has
(12/18 13:59:16) laloona: Hello Mr. Sharper, nice to meet you
(12/18 13:59:17) Tweek: Well Dr Watson made some comments about Phil earlier
(12/18 13:59:25) Brian Fioca: what did he say?
(12/18 13:59:27) KnitCucmber: *giggle*
(12/18 13:59:27) Douglas Sharper: So I've heard.
(12/18 13:59:37) Tweek: It was going good doug..then the soaps came on TV so I had to redirect my attention
(12/18 13:59:46) Katherian: Douglas, I am putting together a group of people forming a Guild to do specifically what you've been talking about...Finding out. Researching. Inquiring.
(12/18 13:59:58) Douglas Sharper: Interesting.
(12/18 14:00:09) Tah: That is a great idea katherian
(12/18 14:00:11) KnitCucmber: *snort* $2.50 :)
(12/18 14:00:15) laloona: Are there news about Phil?
(12/18 14:00:17) Katherian: SOMEONE has got to find out what's going on.
(12/18 14:00:20) Douglas Sharper: Tweek you have more attitude than usual today. I like it.
(12/18 14:00:25) Katherian: Yes, what about poor phil? :(
(12/18 14:00:34) Cycreim: Hmm, you know Doug, we may agree on more points than I thought we would.
(12/18 14:00:35) KnitCucmber: He's worth at least $10. Phil is.
(12/18 14:00:41) Tweek: Knit> well I suppose $5 for you
(12/18 14:00:46) KnitCucmber: Yeah!!!
(12/18 14:00:54) Tah: I think Phil will be fine...as long as yeesha is with him
(12/18 14:00:56) Katherian: Beh. You just like Tweek more because he's reactionary like you, Douglas. ;) <laughs> j/k hehehe
(12/18 14:00:57) Tweek: I was going to try and Kidnapp Dr Watson couldnt find him tho
(12/18 14:00:58) Xia: For once I agree with Katherian.
(12/18 14:00:58) Douglas Sharper: I'm sure we do. I'm a reasonable man.
(12/18 14:01:02) Deg: Tweek, what about the soap opera Sharper started?
(12/18 14:01:12) Brian Fioca: oh, it's Deg
(12/18 14:01:14) Douglas Sharper: Perhpas a little agressive at times.
(12/18 14:01:17) Nelson: You make it sound as though Yeesha is some sort of god-figure, Tah
(12/18 14:01:19) Brian Fioca: run away Deg... it's not safe
(12/18 14:01:24) Douglas Sharper: But reasonable.
(12/18 14:01:27) Cycreim: Any news on where they're keeping Phil, anyway?
(12/18 14:01:29) Jon deMorgan: Tweek, you've switched sides then?
(12/18 14:01:35) Tweek: Deg> Yes.....Sharper who dare you run off with my wife...wait I dont have a wife..
(12/18 14:01:37) Cycreim: Reasonable. That's a quality I look for.
(12/18 14:01:45) Katherian: What's this about Yeesha being with phil...?
(12/18 14:01:48) laloona: Why won't the DRC us to explore the city? Perhaps because of Bahro?
(12/18 14:01:51) Deg: Voices in your head Brian? reminds me of someone...
(12/18 14:01:52) Douglas Sharper: Tweek is the third party - the happy happy peace people.
(12/18 14:01:54) Tah: no, phil believes in her unique gifts and that she is very powerful
(12/18 14:01:56) Tweek: Jon>No but kidnapping Watson would have been amusing
(12/18 14:02:01) an'nie: Now I Understand why your name is Tweek!!!!
(12/18 14:02:05) an'nie laughs
(12/18 14:02:07) Brian Fioca: happy happy
(12/18 14:02:12) Tweek: Yep...we sit around hugging trees and smoking pipes
(12/18 14:02:20) KnitCucmber: We could have just all stood around Watson and jumped. He wouldn't have been able to go anywhere.
(12/18 14:02:21) Katherian: Haha <laughs at Doug's comment>
(12/18 14:02:22) Tweek: would you like a flower in your hair?
(12/18 14:02:23) Deg: Douglas, I thought you were the hippy, not Tweek
(12/18 14:02:37) Tah: IF Yeesha can give extraordinary gifts...then she can find Phil
(12/18 14:02:52) Douglas Sharper: I'm a strange hippy then.
(12/18 14:02:58) Douglas Sharper: You must not know hippies.
(12/18 14:03:02) Brian Fioca: heh
(12/18 14:03:04) Katherian: I'm also wondering what (if anything?) the DRC are doing with that one D'Ni survivor that they also kidnapped...?
(12/18 14:03:06) Cycreim: I've heard even less about Yeesha than I have about Phil.
(12/18 14:03:08) Jon deMorgan: Very
(12/18 14:03:21) Nelson: They said that they found them, did they take him/her into custody?
(12/18 14:03:22) Deg: They did not kidnap the D'ni survivor.
(12/18 14:03:26) Deg: You need to work on your verbs.
(12/18 14:03:31) Brian Fioca: so are we, Kath.. they won't say... try asking the DRC about it
(12/18 14:03:33) Cycreim: They apparently kidnapped. I'm not even sure that's true, Kat.
(12/18 14:03:34) Tweek: hes working the salt mines
(12/18 14:03:38) Katherian: Oh okay...Thus why I put the question mark at the end of my statement, Deg. ;) Relax.
(12/18 14:03:39) Brian Fioca: they won't answer
(12/18 14:03:58) Tweek: well Phil is dead...so says the brotherhood..<snerks>
(12/18 14:04:03) Deg starts to laugh
(12/18 14:04:05) Brian Fioca: brotherhood?
(12/18 14:04:07) Cycreim: It could just be a rumor.
(12/18 14:04:11) Nelson: If he is dead, he'll make an excellent martyr
(12/18 14:04:12) an'nie: the brotherhood huh??
(12/18 14:04:12) laloona: Phil is dead????
(12/18 14:04:14) Cycreim: In fact it probably is.
(12/18 14:04:14) Katherian: And I'd also like to know when they intend on proceeding with their ill-conceived notion of reactivating the Zero.
(12/18 14:04:16) Tweek: some guy on the DRC forums
(12/18 14:04:17) Douglas Sharper: I thought you were a fan of Phil Tweek.
(12/18 14:04:24) Cycreim: Oh god, not the Brotherhood.
(12/18 14:04:29) Tweek: Doug> I am
(12/18 14:04:31) Nelson: What's wrong with the Great Zero reactivation?
(12/18 14:04:36) Jon deMorgan: They might answer if we stopped breaking things.
(12/18 14:04:37) Tweek: I dont believe hes dead...
(12/18 14:04:42) Deg: Some rumor that Brotherhood started... see how smart that mob is?
(12/18 14:04:58) Douglas Sharper: I doubt he's dead.
(12/18 14:05:02) Xia: The DRC seriously needs a good PR person.. all this not answering. It's just plain silly.
(12/18 14:05:04) Tweek: Deg> Oh shh just cause I cant tye my own shoe laces
(12/18 14:05:19) Cycreim: What could he possibly die from?
(12/18 14:05:34) Nelson: Them murdering him would be the most obvious, but they aren't that foolish
(12/18 14:05:45) Brian Fioca: they arent evil
(12/18 14:05:45) Tweek: Well there is that lunch bag on the Doktah building its sure been there a while
(12/18 14:05:50) Brian Fioca: just oppressive...?
(12/18 14:05:52) Deg: Maybe Phil is hiding underneath a cone somewhere.
(12/18 14:05:58) Elspeth: Nelson, what's wrong with activating the GZ is that we don't know what's wrong, what it does.... what the consequences will be. And as usuall they aren't telling us.
(12/18 14:06:00) Jon deMorgan: They won't kill him.
(12/18 14:06:01) lost pupil: who said he was dead?
(12/18 14:06:02) Cycreim: No, I expect them to at least be above manslaughter.
(12/18 14:06:06) Katherian: Insofar as the zero goes...I'm personally VERY worried that firing up technology that we BARELY understand on such a large scale is just going to give the cavern a brand new sun roof. :(
(12/18 14:06:13) Tah: has anyone heard of ANYONE dying here so far?
(12/18 14:06:26) Brian Fioca: nope
(12/18 14:06:27) Nelson: I wouldn't mind, All we'd have to do is panic link as soon as the power up starts
(12/18 14:06:29) Elspeth: Katherian, I'd feel better if the DRC had mentioned what they THINK it does....
(12/18 14:06:31) Cycreim: Not me.
(12/18 14:06:32) Katherian: And Phil is alive.
(12/18 14:06:32) Tweek: most of the D'ni technology is connected to the Great Zero apparently
(12/18 14:06:35) an'nie: no they just get dragged off...
(12/18 14:06:37) Deg: Nope. Except for a few braincells of a few people...
(12/18 14:06:38) Jon deMorgan: You'll use the books though we don't understand them
(12/18 14:06:50) Tah: Karherian I think so too
(12/18 14:06:50) Cycreim: But then again, we've been fairly sectioned off from most areas that the DRC has access to.
(12/18 14:06:54) Katherian: Books are different. Books are not Machines, per se.
(12/18 14:07:08) Elspeth: Also, whom do we risk besides ourselves when we use a book?
(12/18 14:07:09) Nelson: But they're D'ni technology so advanced that they appear to be magic
(12/18 14:07:16) Elspeth: So far, no one.
(12/18 14:07:25) Jon deMorgan: Define the difference.
(12/18 14:07:28) Elspeth: The Great Zero could affect everyone.
(12/18 14:07:29) Katherian: Books do not have moving parts that might go flying across the cavern due to ill-repair and decapitating people at random... :-\
(12/18 14:07:36) Elspeth: We just don't know. And no one is telling.
(12/18 14:07:47) laloona: Mr. Sharper, what about the Bahro? What do you think about?
(12/18 14:07:59) Deg: Maybe since noone knows yet, Elspeth?
(12/18 14:08:11) Elspeth: If no one knows, we shouldn't be turning the fool thing on!
(12/18 14:08:11) Cycreim: Well, I'm sure they took a good long look at how it works, Kath.
(12/18 14:08:17) Katherian: Well I presume the DRC at least THINK they know.
(12/18 14:08:22) Elspeth: "Let's see what this button does..." famous last words
(12/18 14:08:29) Katherian: Precisely.
(12/18 14:08:30) Cycreim: I don't think they'd be firing it off if they had NO clue what it did.
(12/18 14:08:30) Nelson: You didn't know what the MYST book was, but you used that, didn't you?
(12/18 14:08:30) Katherian nods her head
(12/18 14:08:45) Elspeth: Sorry... Mr. Sharper... would liketo hear the answer to laloona's good question
(12/18 14:08:49) Jon deMorgan: Trial and error. How most discoveries are made
(12/18 14:08:49) Katherian: You are giving them a lot of confidence, Cycreim. Any particular reason why?
(12/18 14:08:55) Tweek: please Bahro is such a negitive word man call them the humanally challanged its way more groovy...come lets gather round the fire and sings songs
(12/18 14:09:13) Katherian: Heh <pats Tweek gently>
(12/18 14:09:13) Deg claps his hands
(12/18 14:09:13) Douglas Sharper: I don't know enough about the Bahro.
(12/18 14:09:15) Elspeth: Tweek, come over and join thet Filk Song Army. We're all about that.
(12/18 14:09:21) Nelson: Until we know what they call themselves, I'm sticking with the shorter Bahro :)
(12/18 14:09:23) Tweek: lol
(12/18 14:09:31) Jon deMorgan: Not enough to hunt them, yet?
(12/18 14:09:31) Elspeth: Mr. Sharper, there are some in D'ni though, aren't there?
(12/18 14:09:34) Tweek: called Bobs
(12/18 14:09:46) Deg: What about Bob?
(12/18 14:09:47) Cycreim: Because they may be into kidnapping and stuff but they aren't stupid, or evil.
(12/18 14:09:47) Douglas Sharper: Rumors would say yes.
(12/18 14:09:51) Katherian: Bobs??? As in Twin Peaks? lol
(12/18 14:09:57) laloona: I can use another name but I only know that word - sorry :-)
(12/18 14:10:06) Nelson: How could htere be D'ni survivors? D'ni fell too long ago for any of them to be around still
(12/18 14:10:26) Katherian: That's a tad presumptious of you, Nelson. They went to Releeshan.
(12/18 14:10:28) Elspeth: Nelson... descendants of survivors?
(12/18 14:10:31) Douglas Sharper: They lived to be 300. D'ni fell 200 years ago.
(12/18 14:10:35) Cycreim: Nelson, especially since they just found one of them. Or so say the rumors.
(12/18 14:10:38) Douglas Sharper: Roughly.
