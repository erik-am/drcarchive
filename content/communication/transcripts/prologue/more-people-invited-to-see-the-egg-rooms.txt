(12/19 22:19:34) Douglas Sharper: Good. We'll need them.
(12/19 22:19:43) Douglas Sharper: I wish I could hear how the DRC tried to play off this Phil meeting.
(12/19 22:19:54) Brian Fioca: did you hear about it daed?
(12/19 22:20:04) Daedalus: sorry i came into the convo late

(12/19 22:20:58) Brian Fioca: good or bad
(12/19 22:20:58) Douglas Sharper: She's requesting an interview.
(12/19 22:20:59) Brian Fioca: not sure
(12/19 22:21:02) Daedalus: she claims to be neutral
(12/19 22:21:04) Daedalus: yes
(12/19 22:21:04) Douglas Sharper: Hello Pehpsee
(12/19 22:21:09) Douglas Sharper: I don't think we've ever met.
(12/19 22:21:11) Brian Fioca: she wants her own part in this
(12/19 22:21:15) Daedalus: i was speaking with her about it before i rushed here
(12/19 22:21:18) Pehpsee: hi! Daed, Brian!!
(12/19 22:21:22) Brian Fioca: she's upset that she got no recognition from her help in the city
(12/19 22:21:25) Douglas Sharper: Have you seen the private rooms?
(12/19 22:21:28) Daedalus: gave her my KI
(12/19 22:21:34) Douglas Sharper: Her help in the city?
(12/19 22:21:37) Brian Fioca: yes
(12/19 22:21:38) Daedalus: yes, doug
(12/19 22:21:39) Douglas Sharper: What?
(12/19 22:21:45) Brian Fioca: she claims she cleared space for you yesterday
(12/19 22:21:50) Pehpsee: i am going to go look now
(12/19 22:21:54) Brian Fioca: and wants political influence
(12/19 22:21:54) Daedalus: huh?
(12/19 22:21:54) Douglas Sharper: Ah...she may have.
(12/19 22:21:59) Brian Fioca: she did
(12/19 22:22:00) Brian Fioca: but
(12/19 22:22:07) Brian Fioca: she seems too eager for power
(12/19 22:22:11) Daedalus: hmm
(12/19 22:22:15) Douglas Sharper: Should I meet with her?
(12/19 22:22:23) Brian Fioca: yes, i think it would be good
(12/19 22:22:25) Brian Fioca: but,
(12/19 22:22:32) Brian Fioca: she doesn't like you i'm afraid
(12/19 22:22:37) Daedalus: Sharper -- how did you know that she wanted an interview?
(12/19 22:22:43) Douglas Sharper: She just asked me.
(12/19 22:22:45) Brian Fioca: she just wants your support i guess, for her "guild"
(12/19 22:23:08) Daedalus: she sent a letter to us about it
(12/19 22:23:14) Douglas Sharper: A letter?
(12/19 22:23:19) Daedalus: she claims to be neutral
(12/19 22:23:20) Douglas Sharper: Ugh.
(12/19 22:23:23) Daedalus: to the Echo, yes
(12/19 22:23:27) Douglas Sharper: I'm so tired of these neutral people.
(12/19 22:23:31) Brian Fioca: she could be a very strong leader, but... she's very extremist, by her words
(12/19 22:23:33) Brian Fioca: i agree
(12/19 22:23:34) Daedalus: however
(12/19 22:23:34) Douglas Sharper: These peace lovers.
(12/19 22:23:35) Daedalus: hear this
(12/19 22:23:41) Douglas Sharper: I'm tried period right now.
(12/19 22:23:45) Brian Fioca: right
(12/19 22:23:47) Daedalus: her letter made it sound like she was against protesting
(12/19 22:23:49) Brian Fioca: i understand
(12/19 22:23:51) Douglas Sharper: There is too much going on.
(12/19 22:23:54) Daedalus: it sounded a bit pro-DRC
(12/19 22:24:05) Daedalus: very bizarre
(12/19 22:24:09) Brian Fioca: so, what should we focus on
(12/19 22:24:23) Daedalus: but i think her intentions are "neutral", whatever that might mean.,..
(12/19 22:24:26) Brian Fioca: gathering support i suppose
(12/19 22:24:33) Douglas Sharper: Pehpse, what did you think?
(12/19 22:24:46) Douglas Sharper: Gathering suport. Prearing for the "wrath" of the DRC.
(12/19 22:24:52) Brian Fioca: got it
(12/19 22:24:59) Daedalus: "wrath" thats funny
(12/19 22:25:11) Douglas Sharper: Ha.
(12/19 22:25:15) Pehpsee: They are beautiful but I still don't see quite how they work
(12/19 22:25:23) Douglas Sharper: We'll show you.
(12/19 22:25:26) Daedalus: makes me wonder though
(12/19 22:25:42) Brian Fioca: by the way, can i try to get to your relto again? it didn't work earlier
(12/19 22:25:48) Douglas Sharper: yes.

(12/19 22:28:01) Brian Fioca: you can't hear anything on either side of the door
(12/19 22:28:11) Daedalus: it is interesting
(12/19 22:28:14) Brian Fioca: yes
(12/19 22:28:17) Heuris: all I get is blah blah blah...
(12/19 22:28:20) Brian Fioca: the DRC don't want us here for some reason
(12/19 22:28:26) Brian Fioca: well, pepsi is in there
(12/19 22:28:30) Brian Fioca: and i was trying to see if she heard me
(12/19 22:28:32) Daedalus: i want to see the acoustics work in the hall though
(12/19 22:28:33) Brian Fioca: but she can't
(12/19 22:28:42) Daedalus: she can't hear us
(12/19 22:28:44) Brian Fioca: hi pepsi!!
(12/19 22:28:47) Daedalus: neither can sharper
(12/19 22:28:47) Brian Fioca: see?
(12/19 22:28:57) Brian Fioca: wonder what they're talking about...
(12/19 22:29:31) Heuris: Does this place have a name?
(12/19 22:29:31) Daedalus laughs
(12/19 22:29:38) Brian Fioca: see?
(12/19 22:29:40) Brian Fioca: quiet in there
(12/19 22:29:42) Pehpsee: hi!

(12/19 22:30:00) Douglas Sharper: Heuris, have we met/
(12/19 22:30:01) Brian Fioca: many people are noticing me more now
(12/19 22:30:08) Brian Fioca: wonder why
(12/19 22:30:16) Heuris: No, not until now
(12/19 22:30:17) Brian Fioca: hi Heuris
(12/19 22:30:17) Douglas Sharper: Katherian is currently trying to tell me she supports us.
(12/19 22:30:23) Douglas Sharper: She says to talk to you Brian.
(12/19 22:30:23) Daedalus: really?
(12/19 22:30:27) Heuris: it's a pleasure
(12/19 22:30:32) Brian Fioca: invite her
(12/19 22:30:36) Brian Fioca: i'm interested in what she has to say
(12/19 22:31:04) Heuris: Thank you for the invitation to see this
(12/19 22:31:13) Douglas Sharper: Of course.
(12/19 22:31:13) Brian Fioca: the more the merrier, Heuris
(12/19 22:31:25) Brian Fioca: it's important to see that there was no reason to block this area off
(12/19 22:31:35) Brian Fioca: other than to keep us from talking... privately
(12/19 22:31:43) Heuris: Are we to see more of these in neighborhoods in the future?
(12/19 22:31:46) Daedalus: Sharper -- do you want me to post this in the news?
(12/19 22:31:53) Daedalus: that you opened this place...
(12/19 22:31:58) Douglas Sharper: Post what?
(12/19 22:32:04) Douglas Sharper: The opening of these rooms?
(12/19 22:32:07) Brian Fioca: yes
(12/19 22:32:13) Daedalus: I'm writing the daily news now
(12/19 22:32:26) Douglas Sharper: Hmmm...yes. Emphasize the safety of the rooms though.
(12/19 22:32:34) Douglas Sharper: Emphasize that you have no idea why they have been closed.
(12/19 22:32:35) Daedalus: not a problem
(12/19 22:32:42) Pehpsee: Yes they seem quite safe to me
(12/19 22:32:54) Estrelle: shorah all
(12/19 22:32:57) Brian Fioca: is katherian coming then?
(12/19 22:33:00) Pehpsee: hi! Est
(12/19 22:33:02) Pehpsee waves
(12/19 22:33:02) Heuris: hello
(12/19 22:33:05) Estrelle: pepsi!!!!!
(12/19 22:33:06) Douglas Sharper: I assure you, they are very safe.
(12/19 22:33:08) Daedalus: can i get a shot of you for it, Doug?
(12/19 22:33:15) Douglas Sharper: Sure.
(12/19 22:33:27) Daedalus: smile.
(12/19 22:33:38) Douglas Sharper: I think the DRC knows anyway.
(12/19 22:33:40) Douglas Sharper: Consequences are coming regardless.
(12/19 22:34:02) Brian Fioca: it's all for a good cause
(12/19 22:34:07) Daedalus: What do you think they'll do?
(12/19 22:34:19) Douglas Sharper: Hello Estrelle. Have you heard anything of someone meeting Phil?
(12/19 22:34:31) Douglas Sharper: I don't know what they will do.
(12/19 22:34:49) Daedalus: Kat is here
(12/19 22:34:59) Katherian: kat is also wondering where everyone is. lol
(12/19 22:35:08) Pehpsee: The egg room
(12/19 22:35:09) Brian Fioca: we're in the room next to the classroom
(12/19 22:35:23) Katherian waves
(12/19 22:35:28) Pehpsee waves
(12/19 22:35:28) Katherian: so you got your rooms opened, eh?
(12/19 22:35:30) Heuris waves
(12/19 22:35:33) Katherian: [impressed]
(12/19 22:35:35) Douglas Sharper: Yes.
(12/19 22:35:46) Douglas Sharper: As they should have been long ago by the DRC.
(12/19 22:35:50) Brian Fioca: you changed, kat
(12/19 22:36:03) Katherian: as I was about to say from my hood, Doug...Our #1 goal NEEDs to be at this moment in space & time, infiltrating their "secret island lair". ASAP.
(12/19 22:36:13) Brian Fioca: what?
(12/19 22:36:15) Katherian: Changed? ^ ^
(12/19 22:36:19) Daedalus: interesting way of putting it
(12/19 22:36:24) Estrelle: so douglas what else do you have in store?
(12/19 22:36:33) Douglas Sharper: secret island lair?
(12/19 22:36:36) Katherian: my guess is they have moved a LOT of the historical record there.
(12/19 22:36:45) Katherian: you mentioned it in your journal, hon. heh
(12/19 22:36:47) Douglas Sharper: Whatever I can do.
(12/19 22:36:58) Douglas Sharper: Please don't call me hon. You don't know me.
(12/19 22:37:04) Katherian: sorry. hehe.
(12/19 22:37:06) Katherian laughs
(12/19 22:37:10) Katherian: 20 years of theatre. ;)
(12/19 22:37:13) Katherian: i call everyone hon.
(12/19 22:37:15) Estrelle: make a special relto ans lure all the DRC there and burn the book muahahahaha
(12/19 22:37:28) Douglas Sharper: Theatre?
(12/19 22:37:30) Douglas Sharper: Where?
(12/19 22:37:32) Katherian nods her head
(12/19 22:37:34) Katherian: live theatre.
(12/19 22:37:38) Brian Fioca: anyway... this is getting off track
(12/19 22:37:40) Katherian: Started out in community theatre...
(12/19 22:37:42) Brian Fioca: there's SO much going on
(12/19 22:37:46) Brian Fioca: really
(12/19 22:37:48) Douglas Sharper: Right Brian.
(12/19 22:37:52) Katherian: Then moved up to professional theatre at Cal State Los Angeles :)
(12/19 22:37:57) Brian Fioca: kath
(12/19 22:38:02) Douglas Sharper: I'm not sure I wnat to discuss in public though.
(12/19 22:38:07) Brian Fioca: ok
(12/19 22:38:19) Brian Fioca waves
(12/19 22:38:21) Douglas Sharper: No offense to anyone here, but I'm not sure where you all stand.
(12/19 22:38:50) Heuris: in what way?
(12/19 22:38:52) Katherian: pretty :)
(12/19 22:38:56) Pehpsee: No offense taken...it's not like you know me, you just met me
(12/19 22:38:56) Daedalus: heh
(12/19 22:38:57) Katherian: (btw) lol
(12/19 22:39:36) Heuris: am I overstaying my welcome?
(12/19 22:39:38) Pehpsee: And anyone can say they stand for something and not mean it
(12/19 22:40:14) Katherian: Gods...the ambiance of D'Ni just keeps...I dunno...
(12/19 22:40:26) Katherian: [semi-speechless...which some of you will realize is rare for me haha]
(12/19 22:40:27) Douglas Sharper: Heuris - no, no.
(12/19 22:40:39) Heuris: does this room have a name?
(12/19 22:40:47) Douglas Sharper: Tell me about yourself Heuris.
(12/19 22:40:49) Pehpsee: Keeps what Katherian?
(12/19 22:40:56) Katherian: Boggling my mind? lol
(12/19 22:41:23) Katherian: It's so hard for me to accept/believe that D'Ni became so corrupt in the end when I look at all the beautiful things here. :(
(12/19 22:41:32) Heuris: Well, I was just minding my own business when i felt this call to new mexico...
(12/19 22:41:59) Heuris: and the next thing you know i'm here in the cavern
(12/19 22:42:13) Heuris: as far as sides go...
(12/19 22:42:18) Douglas Sharper: Yes/
(12/19 22:42:56) Katherian nods her head
(12/19 22:42:58) Heuris: well, lets say i agree with what you wrote
(12/19 22:43:02) Katherian shrugs
(12/19 22:43:20) Douglas Sharper: Katherian you don't need to comment on everything said by someone.
(12/19 22:43:31) Heuris: and don't really feel comfortable
(12/19 22:43:35) Douglas Sharper: Good Heuris.
(12/19 22:43:41) Douglas Sharper: I don't need to know more.
(12/19 22:43:42) Heuris: with the DRC or Yeesha
(12/19 22:44:06) Heuris: I'm more pragmatic
(12/19 22:44:08) Douglas Sharper: You are welcome to peruse my neighborhood for now and report back to your friends what you see.
(12/19 22:44:15) Pehpsee: Keep reading, keep studying, keep listening and learning Heuris
(12/19 22:44:31) Douglas Sharper: A safe area open to all who visit and one not opened by the DRC for some reason.
(12/19 22:44:38) Heuris: Indeed, Pehpsee
(12/19 22:45:00) Pehpsee: hi! Ash
(12/19 22:45:22) Katherian: [smile at everyone]
(12/19 22:45:34) Brian Fioca: what did i miss?
(12/19 22:45:40) Katherian: god whatever that egg is...
(12/19 22:45:43) Katherian: it's breathtaking.
(12/19 22:45:47) Douglas Sharper: We're gettomg qiote a number of visitors.
(12/19 22:45:52) Brian Fioca: yeah
(12/19 22:45:56) Pehpsee: mr. Sharper?
(12/19 22:45:58) Douglas Sharper: Yes/
(12/19 22:46:08) Douglas Sharper: What did you need to talk about V?
(12/19 22:46:19) Vormaen: Sharper, you might not think me anyone important, but I must speak my peace
(12/19 22:46:27) Douglas Sharper: Go ahead.
(12/19 22:47:03) Vormaen: I represent a lot of folk who do not know whom to trust, and I believe those people need a vocie and an ear
(12/19 22:47:10) Douglas Sharper: And?
(12/19 22:47:27) Douglas Sharper: Do you have any reason not to trust me?
(12/19 22:47:30) Vormaen: Many of those do not trust you, and I am here to find out your stance
(12/19 22:47:38) Douglas Sharper: Tell me why.
(12/19 22:47:42) Douglas Sharper: And I will try to answer.
(12/19 22:48:13) Douglas Sharper: But I am tired, so let's get this going.
(12/19 22:48:17) Vormaen: Many speak of you hiding things from first the DRC, possibly using Phil in an unstable state, and take books that you found
(12/19 22:48:28) Douglas Sharper: What books have I taken?
(12/19 22:48:39) Douglas Sharper: What have I hidden from the DRC that should not have been hidden?
(12/19 22:48:42) Vormaen: It was reported you took books from the Pub
(12/19 22:48:50) Douglas Sharper: That's a lie. Outright.
(12/19 22:48:50) Vormaen: The hunts
(12/19 22:49:00) Douglas Sharper: The hunt. One. To explore.
(12/19 22:49:08) Douglas Sharper: Isn't that why you are here as well? To explore.
(12/19 22:49:24) Vormaen: Have you truly been "enlightened" from your journey with Phil?
(12/19 22:49:33) Douglas Sharper: Have I said I was?
(12/19 22:49:41) Douglas Sharper: I have learned things from my journey.
(12/19 22:49:52) Vormaen: I am here to explore, but what you and the DRC are doing is trying to split the populous
(12/19 22:50:24) Douglas Sharper: I am trying to get people who want to explore. the drc does not want us to. If that causes a split so be it.
(12/19 22:50:31) Vormaen: Is this not to discover.....are we here to learn, not hate?
(12/19 22:50:41) Douglas Sharper: We are to hate what is wrong.
(12/19 22:50:43) Katherian: The DRC doesn't even want us down here.
(12/19 22:50:48) Douglas Sharper: Learn what is right.
(12/19 22:50:50) Vormaen: But no one wants a war, so to speak.
(12/19 22:50:59) Douglas Sharper: It doesn't matter what they want. They have one.
(12/19 22:51:17) Douglas Sharper: There are two sides whether you like it or not. I"m sorry but I can't change that.
(12/19 22:51:17) Vormaen: Would that go against Yeesha's beliefs?
(12/19 22:51:30) Douglas Sharper: What part of her beliefs?
(12/19 22:51:38) Douglas Sharper: That pride and arrogance caused the fall?
(12/19 22:51:49) Vormaen: War is often about pride. Pride destroyed the D'ni
(12/19 22:51:59) Douglas Sharper: What would you have us do?
(12/19 22:52:04) Douglas Sharper: You seem to know the answers yourself.
(12/19 22:52:10) Douglas Sharper: Tell me.
(12/19 22:52:22) Vormaen: Well I would not have you lower yourself to a destuctive path
(12/19 22:52:31) Douglas Sharper: Destructive?
(12/19 22:52:41) Douglas Sharper: Breaking down a false barrier? Is that what you are referring to?
(12/19 22:52:52) Vormaen: It may start with tearing down barriers, but what of lives?
(12/19 22:53:01) Vormaen: Where next?
(12/19 22:53:12) Douglas Sharper: Exactly. Last time I checked the DRC was the one tearing apart lives. Phil's.
(12/19 22:53:27) Douglas Sharper: I will fight that. If you call it war and disagree with me, so be it.
(12/19 22:53:41) Douglas Sharper: But I will not adopt a "sit here and hope everything is fine" attitude.
(12/19 22:53:43) Vormaen: Well, to most Phil was unstable... how are we to know that it was not in his best interest?
(12/19 22:54:01) Vormaen: How do we know you are being honest?
(12/19 22:54:02) Douglas Sharper: That is a sick statment.
(12/19 22:54:05) Douglas Sharper: Did you know PHil?
(12/19 22:54:17) Douglas Sharper: You do not know if I'm honest.
(12/19 22:54:22) Vormaen: When I last spoke to him, he was too....distant.
(12/19 22:54:39) Douglas Sharper: Distant equals unstable.
(12/19 22:54:41) Vormaen: That's right, and I am not the only one.
(12/19 22:54:47) Douglas Sharper: Perhaps I should not be your friend.
(12/19 22:54:50) Heuris: Umm, guys, for the sake of the apparently ignorant, what happened to Phil?
(12/19 22:54:59) Brian Fioca: later Heuris
(12/19 22:55:00) Vormaen: Let's say you seemed to be doing most of the speaking and leading for him
(12/19 22:55:04) Brian Fioca: we'll fill you in
(12/19 22:55:05) Katherian: he was kidnapped by the DRC.
(12/19 22:55:08) Douglas Sharper: By your logic, if someone is distant, then the DRC can take them. Very good.
(12/19 22:55:10) Douglas Sharper: Very good.
(12/19 22:55:14) Heuris: k
(12/19 22:55:19) Douglas Sharper: What are you saying?
(12/19 22:55:23) Vormaen: That isnot what I am saying
(12/19 22:55:38) Douglas Sharper: Well it's what you just argued.
(12/19 22:55:51) Vormaen: You say they did it for the wrong reasons, how do we know you aren't lying?
(12/19 22:56:01) Douglas Sharper: Judge for yourself.
(12/19 22:56:03) Katherian: If that is the criterion for someone being taken away...then I should be next, I suspect. I have a chronic depressive disorder...And I have days where I don't communicate well with others...weeks sometimes.
(12/19 22:56:13) Vormaen: I cannot, all of us are in the dark!
(12/19 22:56:22) Douglas Sharper: I knew Phil. The man was not unstable. Even if he was it's no reason to take someone.
(12/19 22:56:34) Douglas Sharper: Unless you want to live in a place where an unstable man can be taken.
(12/19 22:56:37) Douglas Sharper: I do not.
(12/19 22:56:44) Vormaen: Ten I propose a meeting, with the masses present
(12/19 22:56:52) Douglas Sharper: A meeting for what?
(12/19 22:56:58) Vormaen: For your saftey
(12/19 22:57:07) Douglas Sharper: My safety?
(12/19 22:57:12) Vormaen: a meeting between you and the DRC
(12/19 22:57:16) Douglas Sharper: Ha!
(12/19 22:57:20) Vormaen: In public
(12/19 22:57:24) Brian Fioca: they'll abduct him
(12/19 22:57:27) Douglas Sharper: You are a naive man.
(12/19 22:57:27) Daedalus: a debate?
(12/19 22:57:31) Katherian: Phil was taken in public, Vormaen.
(12/19 22:57:35) Vormaen: Not with everyone standing by
(12/19 22:57:46) Katherian: WITH everyone standing by. :-
(12/19 22:57:47) Vormaen: Was he not led out into the open?
(12/19 22:57:53) Pehpsee: People were standing by when Phil was taken.
(12/19 22:57:53) Douglas Sharper: I don't think the DRC will debate me right now. They are somewhat angry
(12/19 22:57:56) Brian Fioca: what good will it do? why would they agree at this point
(12/19 22:58:18) Katherian: They have no reason to agree.
(12/19 22:58:19) Katherian shrugs
(12/19 22:58:23) Douglas Sharper: And I can tell you the debate now.
(12/19 22:58:25) Vormaen: I do not know, but I am worried about the communtiy, screw the DRC for now
(12/19 22:58:34) Douglas Sharper: What are you worried about?
(12/19 22:58:46) Douglas Sharper: That there is tension?
(12/19 22:58:47) Katherian: Civil strife.
(12/19 22:58:48) Douglas Sharper: Welcome to life.
(12/19 22:58:52) Douglas Sharper: That there are sides?
(12/19 22:58:55) Douglas Sharper: Welcome to life.
(12/19 22:58:59) Katherian: I think is what Vormaen is trying to say.
(12/19 22:59:01) Vormaen: This is harming us, more than anything, the confusion of whom to trust
(12/19 22:59:13) Douglas Sharper: Welcome to life.
(12/19 22:59:20) Douglas Sharper: There are always choices and there will always be.
(12/19 22:59:23) Douglas Sharper: You must decide.
(12/19 22:59:24) Vormaen: Well This new world may end before it starts if this continues
(12/19 22:59:42) Brian Fioca: not if we can help it
(12/19 22:59:55) Douglas Sharper: It will end if we all agree with the DRC.
(12/19 23:00:05) Douglas Sharper: Now I have enjoyed the conversation but I have had a long day and am tired.
(12/19 23:00:07) Katherian: That's a bit extreme, don't you think? After all "This World" existed for 10,000 years perfectly well without our presence. :-
(12/19 23:00:13) Douglas Sharper: We'll have to continue some other time.
(12/19 23:00:31) Katherian: (that was directed to Vormaen by the way)
(12/19 23:00:33) Vormaen: Well right now I am the most opposed to choosing sides, and if you can tell me what really is going on, I will tell others
(12/19 23:00:47) Pehpsee: nite Mr. Sharper!!
(12/19 23:00:55) Vormaen: I will watch, and be listening,
(12/19 23:01:04) Vormaen: goodnight Sharper
(12/19 23:01:06) Douglas Sharper: If you agree with how the DRC is runing this cavern, you choose them. If you disagree, you choose the other.
(12/19 23:01:10) Douglas Sharper: It's quite simple.
(12/19 23:01:15) Katherian nods her head
(12/19 23:01:19) Estrelle: goodnight douglas
(12/19 23:01:19) Douglas Sharper: We'll talk later.
(12/19 23:01:19) Vormaen: life is never that simple
(12/19 23:01:25) Heuris: Goodnight Mr. Sharper
(12/19 23:01:27) Daedalus: nite, Doug
(12/19 23:01:27) Vormaen: thank you
(12/19 23:01:49) Pehpsee waves
(12/19 23:01:50) Douglas Sharper: It's not simple because you are making it complicated V. Until next time..
(12/19 23:01:52) Ashkar waves
(12/19 23:02:02) Vormaen: goodbye
(12/19 23:02:16) Douglas Sharper: Goodnight all.
