phend: The door…I'm in the door…Ah, thank you! Yes.
Terra: You're welcome. Where did you come from?
phend: From there, that place. Who are you?
phend: There are things I have to tell people, Terra.
Terra: What? Tell me.
phend: People must know what I have seen. What is happening…It's dark in there…Hard to see.
Terra: What have you seen, phend?
phend: I am Phil. Phil Henderson. And I've seen so much…So much darkness. I have to tell the DRC things. What I have learned. You must tell them I am here.
Terra: And I've got a feeling that you're not going to tell me, right?
phend: Prepare people to listen.
Terra: How do you want me to go about that?
phend: I can't. I don't know what I know. I…I'm so confused.
Terra: You sound very confused.
phend: It's all so different…My thoughts are so cloudy.
Terra: I don't know how to help you if you can't tell me anything.
phend: I can't think...it's like I'm in the darkness still…Just tell them…tell them I am here…Tell them I need to talk…to them…they must listen to them.
Terra: Okay, Phil.
phend: They are talking…they want to speak.
Terra: Who wants to speak?
phend: Why? Why are you here? Do you hear them?
Terra: I'm an Explorer.
phend: They speak now.
Terra: I can't hear them.
phend: They are calling me…Open the door please…And tell them I will come again…Goodbye, Terra…Thank you.
Terra: You're welcome.
