(12/08 17:15:55) MrM3FaN: Where are you two?

(12/08 17:16:15) phend: Douglas, you have a Relto now, a gift from Yeesha...
(12/08 17:16:29) Douglas Sharper: Yes Phil. Yes, I do.

(12/08 17:17:54) Douglas Sharper: Hello Dusante.
(12/08 17:18:26) MrM3FaN: I to have been absent lately
(12/08 17:18:29) Dusante: a few strange things
(12/08 17:18:36) Douglas Sharper: Strange things?
(12/08 17:18:40) MrM3FaN: The Ki is having problems
(12/08 17:18:40) Dusante: Taliametris has started some kind of group
(12/08 17:18:45) Douglas Sharper: I've seen my share of strange things.
(12/08 17:18:48) Dusante: thats not strange MrM hehe
(12/08 17:18:53) MrM3FaN: lol
(12/08 17:19:08) Dusante: yeah, pretty strange things, on the journey
(12/08 17:19:28) Douglas Sharper: It was not what I expected.
(12/08 17:19:40) Douglas Sharper: No one told me what it really was.
(12/08 17:19:45) Dusante: her organisation is to try and put a stop to other organisations, by making all info free
(12/08 17:19:51) Dusante: yeah its hard to describe
(12/08 17:20:02) Dusante: other people draw different things from it
(12/08 17:20:12) Douglas Sharper: There is so much more to linking than I ever thought.
(12/08 17:20:21) MrM3FaN: Exactly..that is why we are clashing so much with the DRC
(12/08 17:20:22) Douglas Sharper: She has power.
(12/08 17:20:29) Dusante: oh, you mean the linking stones?
(12/08 17:20:41) Douglas Sharper: All of it. The book. The Age. The Stones. The Cloths.
(12/08 17:20:45) Dusante: or the art itself?
(12/08 17:20:45) MrM3FaN: Or the linking from inside a cave without a linking book
(12/08 17:20:47) Dusante: ahhh
(12/08 17:20:50) Dusante: yeah
(12/08 17:21:05) Douglas Sharper: The DRC's linking Books are child's play.
(12/08 17:21:16) phend: she has more
(12/08 17:21:17) MrM3FaN: *hugs Relto book*
(12/08 17:21:30) Douglas Sharper: I don't know how I lived without it.
(12/08 17:21:38) TheEggplant: where are they?
(12/08 17:21:47) Dusante: yeah, i suspect part of the DRC's dislike for her is jealousym who knows
(12/08 17:22:02) Dusante: yeah, that book saved me in the lava quite a few times
(12/08 17:22:09) Douglas Sharper: Ha!
(12/08 17:22:12) Douglas Sharper: The lava.
(12/08 17:22:18) Dusante: yeesh, its hot
(12/08 17:22:26) Strazsha: where are you?
(12/08 17:22:28) Dusante: and falling in garrison
(12/08 17:22:37) Douglas Sharper: I don't think the DRC has any idea of her power. At least not that I've heard.
(12/08 17:22:47) MrM3FaN: You migh tnow this Phil..did the Bahro or Yessha put the Journey Doors were they are at?
(12/08 17:22:56) Dusante: yeesha definetly has alot more up her sleeve
(12/08 17:23:08) Dan'ni: hello everyone
(12/08 17:23:12) phend: i don't know
(12/08 17:23:13) Strazsha: phil, you look a lot like my ex
(12/08 17:23:31) phend: he must have been handsome
(12/08 17:23:35) phend: :)
(12/08 17:23:38) Dusante: I suspect the bahro have alot to do with the link stone technology
(12/08 17:23:40) Dusante: haha
(12/08 17:23:46) Dusante: heya danni
(12/08 17:23:55) phend: I am only joking with you Strazsha
(12/08 17:23:57) Strazsha: did doug finish his quest?
(12/08 17:24:02) MrM3FaN: How is it you can come back through the cave behind the Journey Door in Kemo? I can only enter it but not come back
(12/08 17:24:04) Dusante: well, look :P
(12/08 17:24:04) phend: yes
(12/08 17:24:04) Strazsha: he was!
(12/08 17:24:08) VereaTurus: shorah
(12/08 17:24:11) Douglas Sharper: Doesn't the shirt answer your question?
(12/08 17:24:19) NeoCelt: salut
(12/08 17:24:26) From Strazsha: oh, that's you (no name)
(12/08 17:24:27) Douglas Sharper: Salut.
(12/08 17:24:36) phend: i can't say
(12/08 17:24:37) Dusante: Bonjour
(12/08 17:24:42) Strazsha: you're an id error
(12/08 17:24:48) Dan'ni: ah here you are - hey everyone!
(12/08 17:25:04) Gregor: phil, why don't you wear "her" shirt
(12/08 17:25:12) Dan'ni: nice shirt Doug
(12/08 17:25:20) phend: i will
(12/08 17:25:30) Dusante: because he completed the circle
(12/08 17:25:32) Dan'ni: looks familar ;)
(12/08 17:25:40) MrM3FaN: Are you going to continue to wear her shirt Doug?
(12/08 17:25:41) Dusante: hehe now you know what it means now doug
(12/08 17:25:44) Douglas Sharper: None of you wear the shirt? Why?
(12/08 17:25:47) MrM3FaN: Even when teh DRC are around?
(12/08 17:25:52) Gregor: did your journey take you to new ages?
(12/08 17:25:54) Strazsha: we do, just not all the time
(12/08 17:25:56) Dusante: I do, but it's in the wash right now
(12/08 17:26:06) Dusante: i got it muddy in gira
(12/08 17:26:14) phend: maybe all should wear it now
(12/08 17:26:14) J'nilou: vs etes ou ?
(12/08 17:26:16) Dusante: kinda fell off the waterfall and stuff
(12/08 17:26:21) Demos waves
(12/08 17:26:22) MrM3FaN: She said to wear it when sides were choosen....not sure if that truly has happened yet
(12/08 17:26:35) VereaTurus fait un signe de la main
(12/08 17:26:40) Douglas Sharper: Some have already chosen sides.
(12/08 17:26:40) Dusante: do you have a message from her phil?
(12/08 17:26:40) Strazsha: please don't stand right in front of me
(12/08 17:26:45) phend: maybe not
(12/08 17:26:54) phend: only the same message
(12/08 17:27:03) Dusante: okay
(12/08 17:27:27) Douglas Sharper: Has the DRC mentioned anything about Phil while we were gone?
(12/08 17:27:35) J'nilou: je vois personne
(12/08 17:27:35) phend: only two of you have sided?
(12/08 17:27:39) Dan'ni: I don't think they did
(12/08 17:27:53) phend: Douglas and VereaTurus
(12/08 17:27:54) VereaTurus: phill, it seems
(12/08 17:27:54) Dusante: no, we just don't know if we should wear the shirt all the time
(12/08 17:27:57) Douglas Sharper: Maybe the others have chosen the other side Phil.
(12/08 17:28:08) Gregor: in the DRC forums they said they have to hold a meeting because of you, Douglas
(12/08 17:28:08) Dan'ni: Many people didn't chose sides yet
(12/08 17:28:15) Dusante: which is the other side?
(12/08 17:28:22) MrM3FaN: I have staied nutreul up until this point
(12/08 17:28:31) Douglas Sharper: If you are not for her, you can only be against her.
(12/08 17:28:43) Dan'ni: why can't we be on both sides?
(12/08 17:28:49) Dusante: im definetly not against her
(12/08 17:28:51) Douglas Sharper: Because they disagree.
(12/08 17:28:52) AnubisSL5: how do you choose sides
(12/08 17:29:07) phend: you cannot serve the greatest and the least
(12/08 17:29:08) Strazsha: Yeesha has a different vision for restoration than DRC
(12/08 17:29:19) Douglas Sharper: You can not serve two masters.
(12/08 17:29:25) Dusante: indeed
(12/08 17:29:37) Gregor: how come, that you're so sure about yeesha now, Douglas
(12/08 17:29:42) Demos: but wht choose to serve?
(12/08 17:29:59) Deg: I do not see yet how the DRC's restoration effort is against the Least.
(12/08 17:30:05) VereaTurus: Yeesha is the right side
(12/08 17:30:06) Gregor: do we have to SERVE here in D'ni
(12/08 17:30:14) Douglas Sharper: In time you will see.
(12/08 17:30:16) Demos: my point
(12/08 17:30:25) Douglas Sharper: If you don't already.
(12/08 17:30:58) Deg: I will keep my eyes open.
(12/08 17:31:04) Dusante: darn, i gotta go to a photoshoot, see you all later
(12/08 17:31:12) Strazsha: cu
(12/08 17:31:12) Deg: Bye, Dusante
(12/08 17:31:12) NeoCelt: Even if we agree with yeesha , we don't know everything to have a perfect vision
(12/08 17:31:14) Dan'ni: what you're trying to say is that DRC wants total control?
(12/08 17:31:25) Gregor: Douglas, you sound a bit too much like a preacher, somehow fanatic
(12/08 17:31:27) Demos: assist or help maybe
(12/08 17:31:33) phend: douglas - tell them where your journey will lead
(12/08 17:31:43) Demos: serve is a slave/master relationship
(12/08 17:31:55) Strazsha: we want to understand what you understand
(12/08 17:31:58) phend: not always
(12/08 17:31:59) Douglas Sharper: Gregor you don't have to listen.
(12/08 17:32:14) phend: sometimes it is simply a choice
(12/08 17:32:22) Demos: unless you want sensei?
(12/08 17:32:23) Douglas Sharper: Well said Phil.
(12/08 17:33:01) VereaTurus: From my point of view, DRC is strange
(12/08 17:33:12) phend: they just don't see
(12/08 17:33:18) VereaTurus: We should be more implicate in the restoration process
(12/08 17:33:23) Gregor: but, the Prologue seems all about dead ends, you finally encounter something new douglas, but I get the impression you don't really want to tell us all the truth
(12/08 17:33:36) NeoCelt: If you don't know what is the white and what is the black , you can't choose a side intelligently...
(12/08 17:33:38) Douglas Sharper: have you made the journey?
(12/08 17:33:42) Douglas Sharper: Gregor?
(12/08 17:33:50) phend: life is about dead-ends and new beginnings
(12/08 17:33:51) Dan'ni: Neo - I'm not sure it's balck and white we're takign about/..
(12/08 17:33:56) Dan'ni: more like shades of grey
(12/08 17:34:02) Gregor: Yes, till the bahro was released
(12/08 17:34:11) Douglas Sharper: And what did you learn?
(12/08 17:34:12) NeoCelt: yeah it was just an image...
(12/08 17:34:30) MrM3FaN: I learned much about the pride of the D'ni
(12/08 17:34:41) phend: more will come
(12/08 17:34:49) Strazsha: the returning
(12/08 17:34:56) Dan'ni: I learned that the truth is not what is seen ut what is hidden, that you cannot take without giving something in return...
(12/08 17:35:00) MrM3FaN: and how the way the DRC seems to be doing things is not much off of what caused it's original downfall
(12/08 17:35:00) phend: and more returning
(12/08 17:35:13) Gregor: I learned about Yeesha's opinion about D'ni, a great civilisation
(12/08 17:35:20) Gregor: but they made mistakes
(12/08 17:35:33) Douglas Sharper: And what do you think of her opinion?
(12/08 17:35:44) Gregor: because they were corrupted by their own powers
(12/08 17:35:52) MrM3FaN: I think it follows along with how all great powers fall
(12/08 17:36:10) Gregor: I can agree with her so far, but
(12/08 17:36:17) Douglas Sharper: And how great powers begin to rebuild?
(12/08 17:36:44) Gregor: what do you mean, douglas
(12/08 17:36:50) MrM3FaN: through control and secrecy jus tmy opinion though
(12/08 17:37:10) Douglas Sharper: I mean the same mistakes can be made in rebuilding. The mistakes that cause a people to fall.
(12/08 17:37:17) Dan'ni: so you're implying that the DRC is meant to fall?
(12/08 17:37:21) akiva: where is everyone?
(12/08 17:37:33) akiva: I am too -but I don't see anyone
(12/08 17:37:35) Dan'ni: at least in it;s current state
(12/08 17:37:38) NeoCelt: how to don't make the same mistake?
(12/08 17:37:41) Douglas Sharper: the DRC is a joke.
(12/08 17:37:58) Douglas Sharper: That's why I'm implying.
(12/08 17:38:09) Strazsha: power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely
(12/08 17:38:09) akiva: I don't see anyone
(12/08 17:38:11) akiva: strange
(12/08 17:38:17) Douglas Sharper: Phil are we going somewhere else?
(12/08 17:38:18) MrM3FaN: So are you going to stop working for the DRC then Doug?
(12/08 17:38:29) Douglas Sharper: I don't work for the DRC.
(12/08 17:38:31) phend: We can
(12/08 17:38:32) Douglas Sharper: Never have.
(12/08 17:38:34) Vormaen: where is Phend?
(12/08 17:38:45) Strazsha: can you take us to new places, Phil?
(12/08 17:38:46) Deg: Is the DRC a lost cause? Can we show them their errors and prevent more mistakes?
(12/08 17:38:48) akiva: I'm by the place the heek table should be
(12/08 17:38:52) akiva: no table
(12/08 17:38:54) Gregor: might the DRC has some D'ni survivor, who leads them and is obsessed by the whish to control all ages and their inhabitants?
(12/08 17:38:55) akiva: no people
(12/08 17:39:04) Dan'ni: akiva - come forwarda little we're here
(12/08 17:39:06) VereaTurus: And which side have you choose, Doug ?
(12/08 17:39:19) Gregor: - just a thought -
(12/08 17:39:50) Douglas Sharper: I'm with her.
(12/08 17:40:00) Gregor: Yeesha?
(12/08 17:40:03) Douglas Sharper: Just like Phil.
(12/08 17:40:21) Deg: Gregor, do they even need a native D'ni? Isn't the DRC's pride strong enough already?
(12/08 17:40:25) phend: I will show you something Douglas
(12/08 17:40:41) Gregor: maybe, Deg
(12/08 17:41:36) phend: follow me...
[Note: Phil and Douglas link to Ae'gura]
(12/08 17:45:57) Douglas Sharper: Hello
(12/08 17:46:24) Strife: nice shirt

(12/08 17:52:10) phend: maybe others who will come now?
(12/08 17:52:11) MrM3FaN: Yessha really has shown us much more than I could have imagined already..I will help here cause..I will help the Least
(12/08 17:52:42) phend: there will be new ones coming
(12/08 17:53:00) an'nie: I dont know
(12/08 17:53:02) AnubisSL5: hold on new what?
(12/08 17:53:17) Dan'ni: if it wasn't for Yeesha w'd probably never be here - we owe her everything

(12/08 17:54:05) Gregor: btw: Douglas, you know, the DRC hasn't officially opened this place here, we're breaking the rules
(12/08 17:54:16) Douglas Sharper: Phil I need you to go with me and tell the people all that you know.
(12/08 17:54:17) Dan'ni: rules set BY the DRC
(12/08 17:54:22) MrM3FaN: those of us that have and are willing to help Yessha should be willing to help others with there Journey
(12/08 17:54:27) Douglas Sharper: Will you do that?
(12/08 17:54:27) Dan'ni: and only by them
(12/08 17:54:30) phend: okay
(12/08 17:54:39) Douglas Sharper: Good.
(12/08 17:54:41) phend: where?
(12/08 17:54:43) MrM3FaN: Why not tell all of use here?
(12/08 17:54:46) Deg: Some rules are meant to be broken, Gregor.
(12/08 17:54:57) Strazsha: do you mean tell DRC?
(12/08 17:55:01) Douglas Sharper: Anywhere. Wherever there are people.

(12/08 17:56:28) Gregor: has yeesha access to ages, of which the DRC know nothing?
(12/08 17:56:29) MrM3FaN: How about Kemo..seems fiting since that is where all this started for you Phil!?
(12/08 17:56:47) phend: I will go to Relto now though - to rest
