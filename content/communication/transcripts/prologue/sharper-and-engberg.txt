(11/25 19:28:16) Blue Max: What do you mean don't stand so close? I haven't seen you at all in the past few minutes
(11/25 19:28:18) Douglas Sharper: Look cold Rivenchan.
(11/25 19:28:23) Rivenchan: (laughs) you're afraid of crowds, Doug?
(11/25 19:28:25) D'Airyair: you have to find the goggles and look underwater
(11/25 19:28:37) Rivenchan: i'm always cold. besides, we're in a cave - it's warranted :P
(11/25 19:30:05) Blue Max points
(11/25 19:30:07) Rivenchan: anyway.. you've probably known Shroomie longer than any of us have, have you noticed anything more about her? besides that she's afraid of loud things?
(11/25 19:30:24) jimmyjack: they took a bunch of cones and barricades away for your debut
(11/25 19:30:26) Douglas Sharper: Of course.
(11/25 19:30:47) Rivenchan: Have you noticed anything more about her that you'd be willing to share with the group..? ^_^
(11/25 19:31:00) Douglas Sharper: What would you like to know?
(11/25 19:31:13) Rivenchan: any tips on how to lure her into the main lagoon?
(11/25 19:31:34) Rivenchan: or even, how to lure her to the spore machine?
(11/25 19:31:39) Douglas Sharper: She's been scared lately. Maybe all the people. As I told a group yesterday I'm working on some ways to get her closer.
(11/25 19:31:40) Veovis: shorah tay this is beta tester Atrus
(11/25 19:31:58) Douglas Sharper: The pods are moving further out.
(11/25 19:32:08) Douglas Sharper: Migration maybe. Not sure.
(11/25 19:32:42) Rivenchan: wow, neat :) you think you'll be studying it, or will you be too caught up in restoring your new pub?
(11/25 19:33:26) Douglas Sharper: A little of both Rivenchan.
(11/25 19:33:27) Blue Max: Hmmm... I've got an appointment on the surface, so I'll make my way down in a bit. Thanks for the info DS!
(11/25 19:33:35) Rivenchan: Bye Blue ^_^
(11/25 19:33:38) Moranda: seems that the study of Shroomie could be full time job
(11/25 19:33:42) Moranda: By blue
(11/25 19:34:08) Rivenchan: What made you take up the pub restoration? Planning to instal a tv and turn it into a sports bar? ^_^
(11/25 19:34:20) Douglas Sharper: No, no. Explorer's Pub.
(11/25 19:34:25) Drew Kempa: If anyone can here me. Move the barriers! We have been called here
(11/25 19:34:49) Rivenchan: Explorer's pub? what will set it apart from the pub we already have here?
(11/25 19:34:50) Douglas Sharper: Maybe bring down some trophies from the surface.
(11/25 19:35:05) Graphite: shorah all
(11/25 19:35:11) Rivenchan: what kind of trophies do you have?
(11/25 19:35:18) Veovis: the barriers have been up for a realy LONG time even in the beta test!
(11/25 19:35:40) YOL: Shorah
(11/25 19:36:02) Douglas Sharper: Mr. Engberg. How goes it?
(11/25 19:36:02) Rivenchan: Greetings, Engberg ^_^
(11/25 19:36:24) Rivenchan: What kind of trophies do you have, Mr. Sharper? Hunting? sports?
(11/25 19:36:26) Moranda: HI Michael
(11/25 19:36:26) Michael Engberg: Hello everyone
(11/25 19:36:30) Douglas Sharper: Calmed down any yet Engberg?
(11/25 19:36:40) Douglas Sharper: Hunting.
(11/25 19:36:45) Michael Engberg: Sorry.. I was having KI problems..
(11/25 19:36:50) Rivenchan: What do you hunt usually?
(11/25 19:37:03) Navra: Hi Michael
(11/25 19:37:10) Michael Engberg: Douglas, Douglas.. when will you learn..
(11/25 19:37:11) Douglas Sharper: Ah, all sorts. Lions, Tigers, Bear, Elk. You name it.
(11/25 19:37:24) Douglas Sharper: What's that Michael?
(11/25 19:37:29) David: i can't wait to get into the city
(11/25 19:37:34) Rivenchan: Wow, i thought you needed special liscences to hunt that sort of thing
(11/25 19:37:38) Graphite: here
(11/25 19:37:53) Tah: Why is everyone else so quiet?
(11/25 19:37:55) Douglas Sharper: Nice of the DRC to finally show up. Glad they sent you Engberg.
(11/25 19:37:58) Michael Engberg: I'm always calm..,but we must follow rules..
(11/25 19:38:01) Veovis: dinno?
(11/25 19:38:13) Tah: Michael....so make new rules. Please
(11/25 19:38:20) Rivenchan: What rules in particular, Engberg? :)
(11/25 19:38:23) Michael Engberg: So.. talking about your "wild " hunting stories?
(11/25 19:38:36) NeoCelt: hard to speak to 20 person ,but one ...maybe
(11/25 19:38:41) Douglas Sharper: Just about the Explorer's Pub.
(11/25 19:38:44) Graphite: erg... I just want to visit the library
(11/25 19:39:06) Rivenchan: What will make the Explorer's pub different from the pub we have on Ae'gura?
(11/25 19:39:13) Rivenchan: Besides location, of course
(11/25 19:39:13) Michael Engberg: RivenChan.. just follow what the DRC asks.. and all will be safe
(11/25 19:39:41) Rivenchan: Engberg> in that case, could you recap me in what the DRC asks? :)
(11/25 19:39:46) Tah: Michael...I disagree. We can "look" and yet not spoil anything or harm ourselves
(11/25 19:40:07) Michael Engberg: How is the Pub coming.. I should came check it out soon..
(11/25 19:40:24) Veovis: ihavebeeneverywhere in this city... you cant harm your self!
(11/25 19:40:41) Graphite: when have you ever been able to harm yourself?
(11/25 19:40:42) Tah: Memi back! YEah
(11/25 19:40:53) Rivenchan: How is the pub coming along, Mr. Sharper? :)
(11/25 19:41:06) Douglas Sharper: Slowly.
(11/25 19:41:13) Graphite: Moranda Shorah!
(11/25 19:41:16) Michael Engberg: Rivenchan, just use DRC authorized linking books, stay away for unsafe spots.
(11/25 19:41:22) Rivenchan: have you had any restoration troubles?
(11/25 19:41:29) Moranda: Shoarah, Graphite
(11/25 19:41:47) Graphite: grr... they blocked off the bar too
(11/25 19:41:48) Veovis: someone fell through below the middle stairs
(11/25 19:42:10) Michael Engberg: Graphite.. it has happened..
(11/25 19:42:51) Rivenchan: Douglas, have you had any troubles restoring your pub? any insteresting discoveries?
(11/25 19:42:59) Michael Engberg: We opened the stairs today..
(11/25 19:43:28) Michael Engberg: Progress is moving a long nicely
(11/25 19:43:32) Rivenchan: Engberg> (laughs) we noticed.. you DRC folk have a cruel sense of humor :P
(11/25 19:43:36) Moranda: When can we expect something new..........the stairs don't do much good without a destination
(11/25 19:44:54) Rivenchan: when do you think you'll open up the main courtyard?
(11/25 19:44:59) Michael Engberg: That was humorous??
(11/25 19:45:02) Drew Kempa: Mr Engberg, what is the DRC stance on local wildlife... Namely, the incidents of Shroomie attack?
(11/25 19:45:05) Tah: Hello douglas. how do you lean like that
(11/25 19:45:19) Drew Kempa: Perhaps Douglas can comment?
(11/25 19:45:40) Rivenchan: I thought it was :P Renegade explorers had already found a way over the pylons blocking the stairs off - this was just making their exploration official
(11/25 19:46:24) Rivenchan: do you think this will become a common practice? Letting renegades have access to areas before they're opened by the DRC?
(11/25 19:46:33) Michael Engberg: Shroomie attacks?
(11/25 19:46:41) Tah: ok....lets go on to next floor
(11/25 19:46:45) Drew Kempa: It has been rumoured...
(11/25 19:47:03) Rivenchan: There's always the possibility
(11/25 19:47:25) Tah: HI dug
(11/25 19:47:36) Michael Engberg: Rivenchan.. just follow the DRC and be safe..
(11/25 19:47:46) Moranda: HI dug
(11/25 19:47:53) Rivenchan: Aw, shucks, but that's no fun
(11/25 19:48:03) Rivenchan: Does the DRC not have a very sound insurance policy?
(11/25 19:48:04) Tah: Hello Michael. Why should we be "Safe
(11/25 19:48:16) Rivenchan: Welcome back Doug ^_^
(11/25 19:48:25) Michael Engberg: Fun? So is that why we are down here?
(11/25 19:48:33) Douglas Sharper: Thank you.
(11/25 19:48:42) Rivenchan: I suppose so, we're not really allowed to help with the restoration yet, are we?
(11/25 19:48:52) Rivenchan: so what else is there but fun?
(11/25 19:48:56) Tah: Michael...no. I want to explore and take in the beauty.
(11/25 19:49:11) Michael Engberg: Hey everyone.. lets all go and destroy the cavern.. doesn't that sound fun?
(11/25 19:49:20) Rivenchan: Maybe the cavern really was opened too quickly
(11/25 19:49:29) Rivenchan: lol ^_^
(11/25 19:49:31) Tah: Michael...just why would you think we would destroy it.
(11/25 19:49:36) Moranda: I am down here to explore and study this wonderous place, but am stymied by not having anywhere to go
(11/25 19:49:40) Michael Engberg: Listen to the rules and areas will be opened faster..
(11/25 19:49:46) Drew Kempa: Mr Sharper, are you still hunting local wildlife...?
(11/25 19:49:56) Veovis: shouts to all *Let us onece again have a sit in protest for them to open the reest of the age!*
(11/25 19:50:03) Douglas Sharper: Local? I try to respect the local wildlife as much as possible.
(11/25 19:50:04) Michael Engberg: Break the rules.. and well wait around for things to open.
(11/25 19:50:14) Douglas Sharper: And stay within DRC rules.
(11/25 19:50:20) Tah: Michael change the rules
(11/25 19:50:27) Drew Kempa: So you deny hunting the local wildlife of Teledahn?
(11/25 19:50:44) Alex Rivadeneira: Mr. Engberg, do you enjoy your job? :)
(11/25 19:50:50) Michael Engberg: Douglas.. they said shroomie attacks..
(11/25 19:51:01) Gearogine: I hate to keep asking but has anyone founf the realto islands?
(11/25 19:51:06) Michael Engberg: do you know about anything ?
(11/25 19:51:07) Gearogine: found
(11/25 19:51:19) Douglas Sharper: She can.
(11/25 19:51:21) Alex Rivadeneira does a dance
(11/25 19:51:26) Tah: Michael....about what specifically
(11/25 19:51:27) Douglas Sharper: But you have to get very close.
(11/25 19:51:33) Veovis: everyone /sit
(11/25 19:51:39) Michael Engberg: Douglas.. should I came and check Teledahn?
(11/25 19:51:59) Michael Engberg: opps .. come..
(11/25 19:52:03) Rivenchan: I dont think you have much to worry about, Engberg
(11/25 19:52:03) Tah: onery aren't you....
(11/25 19:52:21) Douglas Sharper: I wish you would come if that will help approve it.
(11/25 19:52:26) Michael Engberg: Tah.. who?
(11/25 19:52:36) Douglas Sharper: It looks pretty stupid for the DRC to not approve the Age when everyone is going there anyway.
(11/25 19:52:37) Rivenchan: With the number of explorers cavorting around, Shroomie's gotten kinda scared, Doug and i think she might be hiding
(11/25 19:52:53) Michael Engberg: Doug we have had this talk..
(11/25 19:53:02) Michael Engberg: in a public forum please..
(11/25 19:53:07) Tah: Michael, you
(11/25 19:53:08) Drew Kempa: I'm sorry, but I've read Mr Sharper's notes...
(11/25 19:53:32) Michael Engberg: please don't talk about .. what the DRC has said..
(11/25 19:53:42) Jared White: Shorah, everyone. It's good to be back in D'ni. Had to leave for a few weeks....
(11/25 19:53:50) Douglas Sharper: What the? You've read what notes?
(11/25 19:53:56) Rivenchan: What has the DRC said?
(11/25 19:54:10) Jared White: Sorry to interrupt, but it's great to finally meet a couple of DRC members.
(11/25 19:54:21) Michael Engberg: Rivenchan.. can't talk talk about it at this time..
(11/25 19:54:46) Tah: Michael....then change the rules and let us look...
(11/25 19:54:58) Michael Engberg: hello Jared
(11/25 19:55:27) Rivenchan: Why can't you talk about it? is it classified?
(11/25 19:55:32) Tah: YOL hello, Northern Idaho for me
(11/25 19:55:44) Michael Engberg: Rivenchan .. yes..
(11/25 19:56:02) Moranda: Okay Michael, what about all the different agenda's poeple of "power" seem to have down here? I has to be counterproductive to the restoration.
(11/25 19:56:02) Rivenchan: Is there a lot of classified material floating around the DRC?
(11/25 19:56:25) Michael Engberg: Tah, change 5 years of rules for some new people.. who think they should get special treatment?
(11/25 19:56:33) Jared White: California for me.
(11/25 19:56:50) Tah: Michael we are adults. WE are careful why not
(11/25 19:57:05) Michael Engberg: RivenCHan.. hope to release some of it soon..
(11/25 19:57:18) Rivenchan: (laughs) Have you had to change very many rules for us? If anything, it feels like cavern life has gotten stricter
(11/25 19:57:26) Tah: Michael...why not now. Rules can be changed
(11/25 19:57:32) Michael Engberg: Different agenda?
(11/25 19:58:10) Tah: MIchael LOOK at the people here. Do we look like we would do anything to hurt this place
(11/25 19:58:11) Rivenchan: What kind of materials do you hope to release?
(11/25 19:58:12) Douglas Sharper: I've heard Dr. K. proposing unclasifying some information. What do you think Engberg?
(11/25 19:58:39) Rivenchan: Dr. Kodama?? Wanting to UNclassify materials? are we talking about the same man here, lol?
(11/25 19:58:39) Michael Engberg: Doug, I think to much.. to soon..
(11/25 19:58:43) Veovis: what i would do for a kortrena right now!
(11/25 19:59:01) Douglas Sharper: Of course you do.
(11/25 19:59:13) Veovis does a dance
(11/25 19:59:17) Michael Engberg: aww Douglas..
(11/25 19:59:30) Rivenchan: Doug, do you think the DRC should declassify more of it's documents?
(11/25 19:59:38) Alex Rivadeneira laughs
(11/25 19:59:46) Rivenchan: (by the way, are you alright with me calling you Doug?)
(11/25 19:59:55) Douglas Sharper: Yes. I hope Dr. K. can convince some of the others.
(11/25 20:00:08) Rivenchan: How do the others feel about it?
(11/25 20:00:10) Douglas Sharper: That's fine.
(11/25 20:00:16) Michael Engberg: I think they should give out some documents..,but what Dr. K wants to give is way to much.
(11/25 20:00:26) Douglas Sharper: Ask Engberg how they feel.
(11/25 20:00:31) Rivenchan: what does Kodama want to give?
(11/25 20:00:44) Tah: Michael....we can handle it.
(11/25 20:00:55) Tah: Why is everyone so quiet?
(11/25 20:01:08) orlando: i was just wondering that myself
(11/25 20:01:18) Douglas Sharper: More Age information.
(11/25 20:01:23) Rivenchan: hehe, maybe i've lulled everyone to sleep with my boring questions
(11/25 20:01:25) Veovis: who here has read the myst books?
(11/25 20:01:37) memiki: maybe we just can't hear them talking.
(11/25 20:01:40) Tah: Memi yep
(11/25 20:01:42) Moranda: well, I have come to the conclusion that barricades are for political safety and not personal safety. Same with keeping all this infomraiont classified. It is a ruse to " keep all the nosey exploreres in line"
(11/25 20:02:02) memiki: Isn't that what explorers do tho.
(11/25 20:02:04) Michael Engberg: most people reserved on the issue.
(11/25 20:02:07) Nick_Yap: Mind me... but heh... you guys are somewhat intimidating....
(11/25 20:02:17) Veovis: who remembers what is under the liberarry floor :-)
(11/25 20:02:35) Moranda: I do
(11/25 20:02:51) Tah: Michael....so many have already explored. It is pointless to keep us out
(11/25 20:02:53) Veovis: good... i cant wait to see that
(11/25 20:02:57) Rivenchan: Ah! good question! Did you find the book to Terahnee in the library, guys?
(11/25 20:03:07) Rivenchan: Or did Atrus remove it?
(11/25 20:03:09) Drew Kempa: Assuming the books are a true account...
(11/25 20:03:11) Douglas Sharper: This would be age information you haven't heard yet. Ages whose names you have never heard.
(11/25 20:03:20) Douglas Sharper: Ages I've never heard.
(11/25 20:03:23) Michael Engberg: .. Dr K is talking to people.. We don't know what we will do about that issue..
(11/25 20:03:25) Veovis: or i
(11/25 20:03:31) Tah: Douglas....someone has
(11/25 20:03:35) Rivenchan: So are you still finding lots of ages?
(11/25 20:03:48) Michael Engberg: Well got to go..
(11/25 20:04:00) Michael Engberg: bye
(11/25 20:04:01) Drew Kempa: Bye Michael
(11/25 20:04:01) Rivenchan: Aww, when do you think you'll be dropping by again?
(11/25 20:04:03) Douglas Sharper: Tell everyone at the Council hi for me.
(11/25 20:04:04) Tah: GOodbye michael
(11/25 20:04:12) Rivenchan: Will you be staying, Doug?
(11/25 20:04:18) Moranda: Nice of you to stop by Michael, take care
(11/25 20:04:28) Douglas Sharper: I might go play some Heek actually.
(11/25 20:04:59) Rivenchan: Oh? Are you very good at it? ^_^
(11/25 20:05:07) Moranda: I'll take you on in a game, Doug
(11/25 20:05:13) Douglas Sharper: Don't know if I would say that.
(11/25 20:05:18) Douglas Sharper: Alright let's go.
(11/25 20:05:26) Moranda: which hood?
(11/25 20:05:29) Douglas Sharper: I hope Engberg doens't go whining to the DRC now.
(11/25 20:05:41) Rivenchan: (laughs) Does Engberg whine a lot?
(11/25 20:05:46) Douglas Sharper: I don't think he liked me bringing up the proposal in front of you all.
(11/25 20:05:53) Douglas Sharper: Probably a bad move on my part.
(11/25 20:05:59) From Demos in Demos's Relto: anybody home? It has taken me over 4 hr to log in down.gif
(11/25 20:06:07) Rivenchan: Do you think you'll get in trouble for it?
(11/25 20:06:18) Moranda: awe gotta push the envelope a little Doug
(11/25 20:06:19) Tah: sorry orland[
(11/25 20:06:36) Douglas Sharper: I agree. Just can't too much. I don't want my pub taken away.
(11/25 20:06:43) Tah: Douglas.....do you see how many of us are here and willing to explore
(11/25 20:06:50) Moranda: understand that,
(11/25 20:07:01) Rivenchan: Do they have a history of taking away projects from people they're unhappy with?
(11/25 20:07:05) Navra: Not neccessarily Douglas, you have a lot of freinds behind you!
(11/25 20:07:17) Drew Kempa: You having renovations done in the pub?
(11/25 20:07:19) Tah: This is an amazing group of people
(11/25 20:07:28) Douglas Sharper: I'm somewhat of a special case. They usually don't give projects to non-members.
(11/25 20:07:41) Rivenchan: How did you weasel your way in? ^_^
(11/25 20:07:42) Douglas Sharper: Ha! They don't control those link stones friend.
(11/25 20:07:52) Rivenchan: (prepares to take notes ^_~)
(11/25 20:07:59) Douglas Sharper: They take them away - that's about it.
(11/25 20:08:26) Jared White: I'm sorry, I think I missed some of this conversation. In a nutshell, what did you propose, Douglas?
(11/25 20:08:31) Douglas Sharper: I was early on enough. Knew some people. They trusted me.
(11/25 20:08:48) From Wheeler in Myst Island (2) Neighborhood: Why can't I get into the city, does anyone know?
(11/25 20:08:49) Rivenchan: How often do they assign people new areas to restore?
(11/25 20:08:53) Douglas Sharper: It's Dr. K's proposal. I only brought it up.
(11/25 20:09:17) Douglas Sharper: Fairly often. they have a lot going on - that's what Dr. K. woud like to share with you all.
(11/25 20:09:29) Rivenchan: And which people did you know to get in?
(11/25 20:09:30) Moranda: For what its worth, I think Dr. K is on the right track
(11/25 20:09:35) Douglas Sharper: Well, it's been fun but I should go.
(11/25 20:09:37) Douglas Sharper: I agree.
(11/25 20:09:44) Rivenchan: Are you still friends with those people now? you seem to be on shakey ground with the DRC, afterall
(11/25 20:09:59) Jared White: Thanks Douglas.
