To Victor Laxman: No problem.
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: It's weird signals again.
To Victor Laxman: From Kemo?
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: Yes, Kemo. Strong this time...
To Victor Laxman: I was just there about 10 minutes ago…I didn't notice anything.
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: Just started in the last few minutes.
To Victor Laxman: Oh. Well, what can I do?
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: I might meet you there... I'll monitor it for a bit. Are you going there now?
To Victor Laxman: I can if you want me to.
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: We better hurry whatever we do. It hasn't lasted long previously.

phend: Hello?
MrM3FaN: Phil, are you here?
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: Are you sure it's him?
phend: I'm behind the door...I saw you! Hello.
MrM3FaN: I don't see you, Phil.
phend: It's dark.
MrM3FaN: Are you in the tunnel? Oh, there you are.
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: I'm losing signal strength. What's happening?
phend: Whoa, what happened?
phend: I'm ready.
MrM3FaN: Phil, you look like your jumping around sporadically.
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: Back again.
phend: It feels okay, now.
MrM3FaN: Phil, I can't keep track of you...It's like your teleporting around Kemo.
phend: I don't know what's happening?
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: What is going on?
To Victor Laxman: Phil is here. But, he seems to be "teleporting" around Kemo. I can't keep track of him.
phend: Can you take me to the DRC?
MrM3FaN: If I can find you.
To Victor Laxman: He wants to meet the DRC. Where can I have him meet you?
phend: I'm here. Where are you?
MrM3FaN: I’m by the door still. Oh, there you are.
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: What is he saying? What does he want?
MrM3FaN: What do you want with the DRC?
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: Tell him the DRC would like to speak with him.
phend: Everything seems foggy...I need to get to the DRC.
MrM3FaN: The DRC would like to speak with you, as well.
phend: Can you take me to the City?
MrM3FaN: Yes, but in a round about way.
phend: Okay. What do I do?
MrM3FaN: Just a sec.
To Victor Laxman: I am taking Phil to the City...meet us there!
[Note: MrM3FaN takes Phil to his Relto]
MrM3FaN: Come into the hut.
phend: This is her place? I've never been here.
MrM3FaN: Yes, this is Yeesha's Age called Relto.
From Victor Laxman in Victor Laxman's Nexus: Tell Phil to go to the Tokotah. We'll meet him there.
phend: And the rain? It feels like her...
MrM3FaN: Yes, the rain was...a gift for helping her with a Journey. Victor says to meet him at the Tokotah...they will meet you there.
phend: Okay. What do I do?
MrM3FaN: Do you know about the Nexus?
phend: Yeah, which book?
MrM3FaN: The far right one. The yellow with the green marking on it.
phend: Are these your books?
MrM3FaN: Yes.
phend: Okay. Thanks!
MrM3FaN: You’re welcome.
phend: I suppose I'll see more of you. Now that I'm back.
MrM3FaN: You might meet some when you get to the City.
Phend: Thanks for your help.
MrM3FaN: You’re welcome.

(11/28 12:31:24) Victor Laxman: Why don't you come to the Tokotah with me right now?
(11/28 12:31:42) Victor Laxman: Get you comfortable.
(11/28 12:31:46) MrM3FaN: I think anything Phil has to say we should all hear!

(11/28 12:34:06) Jaden: I'm just glad he's okay. I'm sure the DRC is too. It would have been a tragedy if something had happened to him.
(11/28 12:34:21) phend: do you hear that?
(11/28 12:34:28) To BUDDIES: Get here quick!
(11/28 12:34:28) Jaden: I heard a rumble

(11/28 12:35:58) GoffyOne: when will we bee able to go there?
(11/28 12:36:05) phend: when it's time Victor...
[Note: Phil runs off]
(11/28 12:36:43) Victor Laxman: Crazy fool.
(11/28 12:37:09) Victor Laxman: We'd appreciate if this was kept quiet for now.
(11/28 12:37:27) Edrick: why?
(11/28 12:37:42) Miroku: he doesn't sound well
(11/28 12:37:42) Jaden: Did you see where he ran off to? He just sort of disappeared from my screen
(11/28 12:37:45) GoffyOne: lets is in we wont say anything :)
(11/28 12:37:53) Victor Laxman: The DRC needs to make some decisions.
(11/28 12:38:09) Edrick: sounds obscure
(11/28 12:38:29) Victor Laxman: Phil is not well. Let us work things out.
(11/28 12:38:49) Miroku: We'd appreciate it if you would involve us in some of those decisions.
(11/28 12:38:59) Edrick: not well, eh...
(11/28 12:39:20) Miroku: We can be of great help in restoring D'ni!
(11/28 12:39:33) Jaden: And help in trying to find Phil :D
(11/28 12:39:49) Miroku: yes, that too
(11/28 12:40:14) GoffyOne: this is strange
(11/28 12:40:21) Miroku: We represent many nations as well as many professions.
(11/28 12:40:52) GoffyOne: I do colsulting work
(11/28 12:41:03) Miroku: Do you hear us, Mr. Laxman?
(11/28 12:41:16) RedTansNax: That was a great show....
(11/28 12:41:17) Edrick: I think he's ignoring us
(11/28 12:41:23) GoffyOne: he must have falen
(11/28 12:41:29) RedTansNax: I don't think Laxman is really here...
(11/28 12:41:55) Lindy: hmmm...i logged the chat...lol
(11/28 12:41:57) GoffyOne: and can´t get up
(11/28 12:41:57) RedTansNax: Again we are fooled....
(11/28 12:42:08) Miroku: as did I

(11/28 12:43:01) Miroku: type /stoplog
(11/28 12:43:03) MrM3FaN: type /stoplog
(11/28 12:43:09) Lindy: forward slash stoplog
(11/28 12:43:11) Jaden: Actually, I think everyone should avoid posting this stuff in the forums, because they may choose to do less and less in front of us because we blabbed.
(11/28 12:43:29) Jaden: He did ask us to keep quiet
(11/28 12:43:34) Edrick: why it's Dr. Watson
(11/28 12:43:53) Lindy: i didn't say i was gonna blab...just said i logged it...lol
(11/28 12:44:04) Jaden: :) I was speaking more toward the person with respect to the echo.
(11/28 12:44:06) Miroku: Hello Dr Watson, Kodama-sama
(11/28 12:49:10) Jaden: I wish the DRC would come out here and speak :) I'd like to meet them!
(11/28 12:49:11) MrM3FaN: What clothes?

(11/28 12:51:24) GoffyOne: yes
(11/28 12:51:36) GoffyOne: lots off faling through
(11/28 12:51:45) Victor Laxman: This is where he was at.
(11/28 12:51:49) Dr Watson: was this where you saw him Victor?
(11/28 12:51:49) Jaden: Perhaps the DRC are right to be so cautious!
(11/28 12:52:06) Michael Engberg: And he ran off?
(11/28 12:52:19) Victor Laxman: yes
(11/28 12:52:22) Marie Sutherland: and he went where?
(11/28 12:52:35) GoffyOne: and there goes another one

(11/28 12:56:05) MrM3FaN: Something here seemed to scare him
(11/28 12:56:23) Miroku: maybe it was the crowd
(11/28 12:56:36) Jaden: I don't think so. He muttered something about hearing a noise before he got spooked.
(11/28 12:56:41) MrM3FaN: No he said he was hearing something..something we coundb't
(11/28 12:56:43) Preachr46: What's happening
(11/28 12:56:55) Miroku: I heard a faint rumble

(11/28 12:57:01) Kirsehn: shorah Dus, Daed
(11/28 12:57:07) MrM3FaN: Also Phil didn't look normal to me when I meet him in Kemo
(11/28 12:57:07) Jaden: But then why would he be afraid of them?
(11/28 12:57:17) Jaden: What did he look like?
(11/28 12:57:19) MrM3FaN: It was as if there was a glow around him
(11/28 12:57:22) Miroku: Phil Henderson was here, and now the whole DRC is investigating!
(11/28 12:57:44) Miroku: I never saw Phil
(11/28 12:57:51) Miroku: but he was close
(11/28 12:57:52) Preachr46: Man, I miss all the good stuff
(11/28 12:58:06) Jaden: I took several screenshots for my Uru scrapbook

(11/28 13:03:18) Miroku: Is there anything we can do to Help?
(11/28 13:03:34) Dr Watson: we're very concerned about the man you may have just seen...Phil
(11/28 13:03:41) Dr Watson: we know you are too
(11/28 13:04:02) Dr Watson: we're doing everything we can to find out more information
(11/28 13:04:04) Miroku: yes, he sounded rather....strange
(11/28 13:04:06) Kirsehn: yeah....he keeps saying there is something he needs to tell us
(11/28 13:04:22) Edrick: indeed
(11/28 13:04:23) Dr Watson: we'll let you know what we find as soon as we know anything

(11/28 13:04:36) Kirsehn: thank you Dr W
(11/28 13:04:47) MrM3FaN: Something here, something he heared seemed to scary him Dr. Watson

(11/28 13:05:11) Daedalus: hmm
(11/28 13:05:14) Preachr46: Yes
(11/28 13:05:15) Miroku: thank you Dr Watson
(11/28 13:05:37) MrM3FaN: Dr. Watson I need to talk to you about how Phil acted!
(11/28 13:05:50) Dr Watson: yes MrM3Fan, I don't think he is quite well. Victor has given us a thorough account
(11/28 13:06:19) Kirsehn: have you ever explored the cave where phil came from?
(11/28 13:06:19) Jaden: I'm not sure if you read, but MrM3FaN said that he saw a halo around Phil when he first ran into him. Wierd eh?
(11/28 13:06:26) Dr Watson: obviously if you see him, or anything else strange happens, please let us know
(11/28 13:06:31) BiGToM: hello everyone
(11/28 13:06:39) MrM3FaN: not a halo..but he had a glow to him
(11/28 13:06:39) Preachr46: Will do
