(05/22 22:47:12)  Ieddo: I know its a recording but u never know. clues take many forms
(05/22 22:47:36)  Gondar: This case just causes crashes and stackdumps.
(05/22 22:47:54)  Gondar: C'mon Wheely..
(05/22 22:48:29)  Tyion: Wheely you can do it, just hang in there!
(05/22 22:48:33)  Victor Laxman: Bloody thing. 
(05/22 22:48:47)  Michael Engberg: What? Is it working?
(05/22 22:48:51)  Gondar: I'd suggest hitting it once or twice. Put fear into iut.
(05/22 22:49:01)  Victor Laxman: Once second. 
(05/22 22:49:11)  Victor Laxman: Once I get this...
(05/22 22:49:45)  Gondar: Dr. Kodama too.
(05/22 22:49:55)  Michael Engberg: Victor, c'mon, what's the problem?

(05/22 22:51:52) Gondar crosses fingers.
(05/22 22:53:10)  Natak: ...
(05/22 22:53:22) Ieddo prays to the Maker
(05/22 22:53:36)  Gondar: C'mon Victor.. you can do it..

(05/22 22:53:56)  Cate Alexander: Michael, it's alright. We're very close to her. Only a few more minutes. 
(05/22 22:54:09)  Gondar: Oh my..

(05/22 22:56:20)  Gondar: YES!
(05/22 22:56:30) Ieddo cheers
(05/22 22:56:42)  Michael Engberg: Wheely, was that her?
(05/22 22:56:45)  Doobes: Aha!
(05/22 22:56:53)  Michael Engberg: Wheely?
(05/22 22:57:06)  Wheely: Dad. 
(05/22 22:57:14) Tyion cheers
(05/22 22:57:17)  Michael Engberg: Wheely, we're almost to you. 
(05/22 22:57:24)  Wheely: I know. I can hear you. 
(05/22 22:57:27)  Ieddo: .dokehn kehrah Wheely .eht kolkehn teh shem
(05/22 22:57:38)  Wheely: I'm so glad. The thing is moving around now. It's scaring me. 
(05/22 22:57:45)  Michael Engberg: 
(05/22 22:58:08)  Michael Engberg: Okay, it won't be much longer. .
(05/22 22:58:16)  Michael Engberg: It hasn't hurt you yet. 
(05/22 22:58:19)  Michael Engberg: It's okay. 
(05/22 22:58:22)  Natak: what thing ?
(05/22 22:58:28)  Wheely: Okay. How much longer? 
(05/22 22:58:59)  Michael Engberg: A few more minutes. We think we're going to be able to lower a Book for you. 
(05/22 22:59:16)  Gondar: ...book might not work.. if it's a bahro cave.. the book migjht not work..
(05/22 22:59:20)  Wheely: I can see some light up there. A little. 
(05/22 22:59:37)  Kerryth: They have to try. Fastest way.
(05/22 22:59:44)  Michael Engberg: Good, good. It will be a small hole but we're going to get a Book to you. 
(05/22 22:59:44)  Gondar: I know.. crossing more fingers..
(05/22 22:59:54)  Tyion: oh come on work please work
(05/22 23:00:22) Ieddo 's holding his breath
(05/22 23:00:35)  Wheely: Dad, it's moving around a lot. It's been moving more and more the past hour or so. 
(05/22 23:00:39) Xavius sniffs
(05/22 23:00:43)  Wheely: I need you down here. 
(05/22 23:01:06)  Michael Engberg: The Book is coming. Just another minute or two. 
(05/22 23:01:47)  Wheely: Are you there? Can you see the hole?
(05/22 23:02:02)  Michael Engberg: I'm here. I'm looking for you. Just a few more. 
(05/22 23:02:26)  Wheely: It makes sounds dad. Is that okay?
(05/22 23:03:03)  Michael Engberg: Can you see me?
(05/22 23:03:13)  Wheely: I see you. It's cleared.
(05/22 23:03:25)  Wheely: Barely. That's a small hole dad. 
(05/22 23:03:29) Gondar lets out breath slowl.
(05/22 23:03:39) Ieddo does the same
(05/22 23:03:40)  Michael Engberg: Oh babe. I can barely see you. I see you. Thank god. 
(05/22 23:03:43) Kerryth remembers to breathe...
(05/22 23:03:46) Xavius cheers quietly
(05/22 23:03:54)  Michael Engberg: Okay, we're lowering a Book down. 
(05/22 23:04:00)  Wheely: Dad it's really moving now. 
(05/22 23:04:09) Hu K'hanDhat crosses hid fingers
(05/22 23:04:19)  Wheely: I don't think it likes this. 
(05/22 23:04:26)  Michael Engberg: It's alright. It hasn't hurt you. 
(05/22 23:04:31)  Gondar: uh oh
(05/22 23:04:34)  Michael Engberg: Okay, babe. See the Book?
(05/22 23:04:38)  Wheely: I see it. 
(05/22 23:04:46)  Wheely: Yeah. I can't reach it yet though. 
(05/22 23:04:49) Xavius swallows
(05/22 23:04:54)  Leonor: Draw a friendship symbol, Wheely
(05/22 23:04:56) From Ja'run in Ja'run's Eder Kemo: how does she know the other is dead? Did she see her body?
(05/22 23:04:59)  Michael Engberg: I know. I know. Keep it going down. 
(05/22 23:05:06) From Ja'run in Ja'run's Eder Kemo: wrong channel
(05/22 23:05:08) Ieddo holds his breath again
(05/22 23:05:30) Hu K'hanDhat draws a frienship symbol for wheely
(05/22 23:05:30)  Wheely: How are we going to get Rose out?
(05/22 23:05:46) Xavius sniffs
(05/22 23:06:11)  Michael Engberg: Wheely, just touch the Book. We'll get Rose out later. 
(05/22 23:06:26)  Wheely: Dad, there's just black. 
(05/22 23:06:29)  Eric Wolfe: I think Rose would want you safe first, Wheely.
(05/22 23:06:32)  Michael Engberg: Just touch it babe. 
(05/22 23:06:36)  Wheely: I am. 
(05/22 23:06:43)  Wheely: It's not working. Dad!
(05/22 23:06:46)  Xavius: @_@
(05/22 23:06:49)  Doobes: Oh crap.
(05/22 23:06:50)  Michael Engberg: Okay. Okay. Babe. 
(05/22 23:06:52) <sniffle> Xavius is sad
(05/22 23:07:02)  Michael Engberg: It's alright. That's okay honey. 
(05/22 23:07:09)  Michael Engberg: I'm going to come down. 
(05/22 23:07:12)  Gondar: It's a bahro cave.. it inhibits a link..
(05/22 23:07:27)  Michael Engberg: We've got to clear a few more stones though. We still have to be careful. 
(05/22 23:07:30)  Michael Engberg: Okay?
(05/22 23:07:46) Ieddo leans his brow on his kneecaps
(05/22 23:07:49)  Wheely: Dad how much longer? I don't like this. It's in the corner now watching me again. 
(05/22 23:07:49)  Gondar: c'mon... almost there..
(05/22 23:07:53)  Eric Wolfe: Is there a hole in the floor?
(05/22 23:07:54) Xavius kneels down...
(05/22 23:08:16)  Michael Engberg: We're right next to you babe. We can see you. It's only going to be another little bit. 
(05/22 23:08:42)  Wheely: Okay... Why isn't the Book working? Dad I want it to work. 
(05/22 23:08:51)  Wheely: I want to get out. 
(05/22 23:09:07)  Michael Engberg: I know, I know. Just a little longer. A little bit. 
(05/22 23:09:11)  Michael Engberg: We're coming. 
(05/22 23:09:33)  Wheely: It's making more noises. 
(05/22 23:09:50)  Michael Engberg: That's alright. It's okay. 
(05/22 23:10:17)  Eric Wolfe: Maybe it wants you to follow?
(05/22 23:10:25)  Wheely: They aren't normal noises though dad. 
(05/22 23:10:46)  Michael Engberg: Willow, it's alright. 
(05/22 23:10:49)  Gondar: It better just want to be freed as well..
(05/22 23:10:54)  Wheely: Not like the noises they usually make.
(05/22 23:10:59)  Eric Wolfe: I haven't heard any bahro cries lately, has anyone else?
(05/22 23:11:01)  Michael Engberg: Okay. I'm sure it's okay. 
(05/22 23:11:18)  Kerryth: (yes, just few minutes ago.)
(05/22 23:11:30)  Xavius: I have a bad feeling about this..
(05/22 23:11:41)  Michael Engberg: Just ignore it if you can. Focus on me. On the light. On the rescuers. We're almost there. 
(05/22 23:11:56)  Wheely: Well, it's like it's trying to talk. 
(05/22 23:12:37)  Michael Engberg: Okay babe. It might sound like that. But I'm sure...
(05/22 23:13:04)  Wheely: Okay, it's just not normal dad. 
(05/22 23:13:18)  Michael Engberg: I know. It doesn't matter. We're almost there. 
(05/22 23:14:32)  Wheely: Dad. What was that?
(05/22 23:14:54) Gondar holds his breath.
(05/22 23:15:04)  Wheely: I can't see the hole anymore. 
(05/22 23:15:06)  Michael Engberg: 
(05/22 23:15:08)  Gondar: uh oh
(05/22 23:15:23)  Michael Engberg: Listen babe. We had a small collapse. It's small. It's okay. 
(05/22 23:15:29)  Michael Engberg: We're still right there. 
(05/22 23:16:02)  Michael Engberg: It's just going to take a litlte longer. But still, we're going to be there in no time. 
(05/22 23:16:20) Xavius swallows
(05/22 23:16:20)  Wheely: What happened? 
(05/22 23:17:03)  Michael Engberg: Honey, the rubble can fall in on itself. It's why we're being careful. A little bit covered the hole. 
(05/22 23:17:33)  Wheely: How much longer? Really?
(05/22 23:17:57)  Michael Engberg: An hour. 
(05/22 23:18:12)  Wheely: An hour?
(05/22 23:18:33)  Michael Engberg: Wheely you've made it this far. You're going to be great. 
(05/22 23:18:44)  Michael Engberg: It's alright. What's another hour. 
(05/22 23:19:32)  Wheely: ok
(05/22 23:19:54)  Junee: Can't they lower down some water or food? 
(05/22 23:21:19)  No'ga: I can see why they are using hand tools if it is this unstable
(05/22 23:21:44)  Xavius: We can only wait..
(05/22 23:21:52) Gondar nods his head
(05/22 23:22:01) Xavius sighs haggardly
(05/22 23:22:39)  Junee: I hope this small cave-in isn't a bad sign... :( 
(05/22 23:22:41)  Ly'net: how close are they to getting Wheely out?
(05/22 23:22:45)  Wheely: It's on the ceiling again. 
(05/22 23:23:12)  Michael Engberg: That's good. Keep away from the hole. We're moving rocks there. 
(05/22 23:23:21)  Michael Engberg: We don't want anything to fall. 
(05/22 23:23:37)  Wheely: I already did. I can hear stuff coming down. Little bits. 
(05/22 23:23:38)  Brayden: Would it be good or bad to try and draw a snake glyph?
(05/22 23:23:54)  Xavius: Bad..
(05/22 23:24:02)  Ly'net: Very very bad
(05/22 23:24:03) Xavius puts a finger to his mouth
(05/22 23:24:17)  Wolfgang D.: Bad. I would trust the Bahro, not try and make it mad
(05/22 23:24:32)  Michael Engberg: There's lots of people down here. We all can't wait to see you. They can all hear you. 
(05/22 23:24:32)  Brayden: It might go away though.
(05/22 23:24:55)  Kerryth: Maybe it can't.
(05/22 23:25:02)  Tyion: are we sure this is a bahro?
(05/22 23:25:20)  Xavius: But it would probably get angry, and we don't exactly know what they can do when they're angry.
(05/22 23:25:23)  Tyion: becuse if you ask me it dosnt seem to act like one
(05/22 23:25:27)  Wheely: I know. I hear them. 
(05/22 23:25:35)  Gondar: Seems to act like one for me.. but we don't know.
(05/22 23:25:37)  Brayden: We're rooting for you, Wheely!
(05/22 23:25:48)  Wheely: I can't wait to get out and see them. 
(05/22 23:25:49)  Eric Wolfe: Maybe the bahro is injured too?
(05/22 23:25:52)  Tyion: maybe it is but a bahro that is not like the bahro we know
(05/22 23:26:05)  Tyion: injured thats a good question
(05/22 23:26:08)  Gondar: Injured or trapped. The cave is a bahro trap I think.
(05/22 23:26:15)  Tyion: maybe!
(05/22 23:26:16)  Wolfgang D.: Perhaps, Perhaps not
(05/22 23:26:28)  Gondar: Idea on the forums. Explain it later afterwards.
(05/22 23:26:33)  Xavius: The city was built when bahro were slaves, that's possible.
(05/22 23:26:35)  Kerryth: Hang in there, Wheely!
(05/22 23:26:42)  Xavius: Maygbe they needed link-proof places?
(05/22 23:26:55)  Ly'net: how is she holding up?
(05/22 23:27:06)  Wheely: I saw the picture of everyone outside. 
(05/22 23:27:13)  No'ga: we are all pulling for you Wheely. Just keep strong and you will be fine.
(05/22 23:27:16)  Junee: But with glowing symbols on the walls? 
(05/22 23:27:30)  Michael Engberg: You have lots of support. 
(05/22 23:27:35)  Xavius: C'mon, Wheely! We're all here, the DRC's here, and your Dad's here!
(05/22 23:27:36)  Ly'net: We're here for you Wheely
(05/22 23:27:46)  Tyion: hang in there!
(05/22 23:27:49)  Gondar: You can do this Wheely!
(05/22 23:27:53)  Wheely: Thanks everyone. 
(05/22 23:27:59) Xavius salutes
(05/22 23:28:18)  Wheely: It's good to hear you. It's lonely down here. 
(05/22 23:28:31)  Ly'net: You're not alone
(05/22 23:28:39)  Junee: Well wait until you get out, don't worry :) 
(05/22 23:28:40) Peace cheers
(05/22 23:29:03) To Tweek: tweek I will get you a log of the chat if you want it after wards
(05/22 23:29:08) Erandel claps his hands
(05/22 23:29:14)  Peace: Hang in there, Wheely!
(05/22 23:29:25)  TiareSim: hooray for Wheely!
(05/22 23:29:33) From Randolf in Randolf's Relto: whats the news
(05/22 23:29:34)  Xavius: I'm not leaving till I see Mr. Engberg and you leave first.
(05/22 23:29:37) Tyion cheers go Wheely!
(05/22 23:29:41) Xavius cheers

(05/22 23:29:59)  drifter: /Reply are you talking to me?
(05/22 23:30:20) To No'ga: They are close had a hole open but it collapsed after a try to give a book that turned out black when she opened it
(05/22 23:30:37) From Randolf in Randolf's Relto: hmm
(05/22 23:30:40) From Randolf in Randolf's Relto: not good
(05/22 23:31:39) Peace offers encouragement to Wheely, her father and the rescue team
(05/22 23:31:44) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: crud, still blocked, cant get in on my own
(05/22 23:31:45)  Ly'net: how close are they to her?
(05/22 23:31:52) Peace offers thanks to the Bahro for protecting and caring for Wheely.
(05/22 23:32:00) Xavius bangs his chest twice and then makes the peace sign
(05/22 23:32:13) To No'ga: they are closer now so they said it will only be an hour or so to reopen it (how convenant)
(05/22 23:32:13) From Randolf (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(05/22 23:32:17) Hu K'hanDhat thinks wheely is doing fine so far
(05/22 23:32:33)  Xavius: Probably a few yards, or less.
(05/22 23:32:39)  Ly'net: Ty
(05/22 23:32:42) Xavius kneels down...
(05/22 23:32:47) To No'ga: Im sorry about that I would leave if I knew it would allow you to get in but Im also trying to relay to CyanChat

(05/22 23:33:50)  Brayden: Think about her... She's been there longer.
(05/22 23:33:52) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: ahh

(05/22 23:36:47)  Wheely: Dad, have you talked to Rose's mom and dad?
(05/22 23:37:01) From Sharaya in D'ni-Ae'gura': What book is black?
(05/22 23:37:04)  Travis Ohms: its good to see Wheelys KI is back on, i just got back into the city
(05/22 23:37:11)  Michael Engberg: Yes. They know. 
(05/22 23:37:13) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: the one they sent to wheely
(05/22 23:37:14) To Sharaya: wheely: dad, have you talked to Rose's mom or dad?
(05/22 23:37:18) Xavius sniffs
(05/22 23:37:23) To Sharaya: Engberg: yes. They know.
(05/22 23:37:36) From Sharaya in D'ni-Ae'gura': What do they know though?  Is Rose dead?
(05/22 23:37:43)  Wheely: I'm so sorry... 
(05/22 23:37:53)  Hu K'hanDhat: Hoop het niet theo
(05/22 23:37:59)  Ly'net: huh?
(05/22 23:38:04)  Hu K'hanDhat: mE: Yes. they know
(05/22 23:38:10)  Michael Engberg: I know. 
(05/22 23:38:15) To Sharaya: I am assuming that at this moment
(05/22 23:38:15)  Hu K'hanDhat: Moest eerst de log weer starten doka
(05/22 23:38:20)  Michael Engberg: We all know it wasn't your fault. 
(05/22 23:38:22)  Hu K'hanDhat: mE: I know
(05/22 23:38:23) To Sharaya: Wheely: Im so sorry
(05/22 23:38:40) To Sharaya: Enberg: we all know it wasnt your fault
(05/22 23:39:08)  Xavius: Dhat, stop.
(05/22 23:39:55) Eric Wolfe leans right
(05/22 23:40:09) Xavius crosses his fingers
(05/22 23:40:31) john Silver crosses his eyes....
(05/22 23:40:39) From Sharaya in D'ni-Ae'gura': Kinda strange how you can go to the pub in your city instance and see a big crack on the floor, but you can't get that far in the main city
(05/22 23:40:52) Ly'net crosses her legs
(05/22 23:41:01)  Ly'net: they really need to get bathrooms in here
(05/22 23:41:15) To Sharaya: thats because the changes havent fully replicated/happened in that instance
(05/22 23:41:20) Tiella cross all I can cross
(05/22 23:41:26)  john Silver: maybe a popcorn salesman... 
(05/22 23:41:48) To Sharaya: (OOC) I know
(05/22 23:42:03) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: hey Sharaya where do you think the new page is?
(05/22 23:42:09) To Sharaya: silence again I will keep you up to date if I get anymore
(05/22 23:42:18) From Sharaya in Sharaya's Nexus: Do you really want to know?  I can pm you if you really want to know
(05/22 23:42:19) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: thanks Noga
(05/22 23:42:26) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: i do
(05/22 23:42:37) From Sharaya in Sharaya's Nexus: I don't want to spoil for the others though
(05/22 23:43:00)  Ly'net: How you holding up Wheely?
(05/22 23:43:13)  Tyion: how is it coming?
(05/22 23:45:01) From Sharaya in Braggi's Bevin: Sure.  : )
(05/22 23:45:05)  Gondar: How much longer did they estimate?
(05/22 23:45:08)  Wheely: I feel alright Ly'net. 
(05/22 23:45:16)  Brayden: An hour. Twas a while ago though.
(05/22 23:45:16)  Ly'net: Good
(05/22 23:45:25)  Wheely: Better than I did last night. I'm not thirsty. 
(05/22 23:45:33)  Wheely: I'm not as tired either. 
(05/22 23:45:41)  Tyion: good to hear wheely
(05/22 23:45:43)  Ly'net: We'll make sure to have water waiting for you
(05/22 23:45:44)  Brayden: Hmm... Really? Did someone bring you water?
(05/22 23:45:59) From Sharaya in Braggi's Bevin: Someone closed the doors in Braggi's bevin and I can't get to the bookroom.  grrr
(05/22 23:46:05)  Xavius: Keep on kickin', Wheely!
(05/22 23:46:09) To Sharaya: Wheely says she is alright 
(05/22 23:46:23)  Peace: Wheely, that must mean the Bahro cared for you last night.
(05/22 23:46:27) From Sharaya in Sharaya's Relto: No.  Not a member of that hood with this avie
(05/22 23:46:35) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: ahh
(05/22 23:46:39)  Tyion: the rain symbol but of worked
(05/22 23:46:40)  Peace: We lost touch with you and were worried. 
(05/22 23:46:41) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: so, why there?
(05/22 23:46:46) To Sharaya: not thirsty and less tired which might be bad because its like the later stages of dehydration if i remeber correctly
(05/22 23:46:50) Ly'net nods her head
(05/22 23:46:53)  meadow: wheely, do you think the bahro is your friend?
(05/22 23:46:54)  Tyion: must not but
(05/22 23:46:56) Xavius shrugs
(05/22 23:47:01) From Sharaya in *The Circle's Bevin: I was looking for Polgara
(05/22 23:47:10) From Sharaya in *The Circle's Bevin: She was on a second ago.  guess she crashed
(05/22 23:47:16)  Tyion: do you think it is a bahro?
(05/22 23:47:18)  Desert Eagle: Wheely, do you think that maybe it was the Bahro that healed you?
(05/22 23:47:19) Hu K'hanDhat is crossing his fingers ... hold on girl .. they will rescue you
(05/22 23:47:23)  Peace: The Bahro appears to be protecting you. Don't fear it.
(05/22 23:47:37) dokaheid starts to laugh
(05/22 23:47:41)  Xavius: She's trapped beneath rubble, she doesn't ned a barrage of questions.
(05/22 23:47:49)  Wheely: My leg still hurts. 
(05/22 23:47:52)  Xavius: o.0
(05/22 23:48:00)  Travis Ohms: So the bahro screachs have completly stoped? not even the normal background ones?
(05/22 23:48:14)  Ly'net: I haven't heard any for awhile
(05/22 23:48:14)  Tyion: thats weird
(05/22 23:48:18) To Sharaya: Wheely's leg still hurts though
(05/22 23:48:24)  Xavius: Does it look okay, or does it just hurt period?
(05/22 23:48:26)  Tyion: maybe there holding there breaht like we are
(05/22 23:48:36)  Ly'net: maybe
(05/22 23:48:36)  Gondar: Probably smacked the leg up when the rock came down.
(05/22 23:48:44)  Gondar: We'll see when she comes out.
(05/22 23:48:55)  Kerryth: Or they're busy.
(05/22 23:48:59)  Wheely: It just hurts. I can't really see it. It's just sore.  
(05/22 23:49:20) Hu K'hanDhat wonders if some rock fell on her leg
(05/22 23:49:24)  Travis Ohms: They may want us to help free the other Bahro
(05/22 23:49:39) dokaheid waves hello
(05/22 23:49:41)  Travis Ohms: If it is unable to link down there
(05/22 23:49:44) To Sharaya: Wheely says here leg is sore and she cant see it
(05/22 23:49:55)  Ly'net: it might need rescuing too
(05/22 23:50:02) From Sharaya in *The Circle's Bevin: She can't see her leg or it's just too dark to see?
(05/22 23:50:06)  Wheely: Dad. 
(05/22 23:50:10)  [ Shadow ]: lol im here
(05/22 23:50:16) From Sharaya in *The Circle's Bevin: Where is her mother?
(05/22 23:50:17)  Desert Eagle: just wondering... do you know any Bahro symbols besides the one for rain? you could try to communicate with it...
(05/22 23:50:25)  Travis Ohms: The book not working could mean its a "no-link zone"
(05/22 23:50:29)  Michael Engberg: Yeah babe. 
(05/22 23:50:34) To Sharaya: Im thinking its dark because people we are talking to here asking questions
(05/22 23:50:46) To Sharaya: I dont know
(05/22 23:50:55)  Wheely: It's scratching the rocks. 
(05/22 23:51:07)  Ly'net: maybe it wants out too
(05/22 23:51:11) From Sharaya in *The Circle's Bevin: Men are useless in a crisis as far as comfort goes.  She needs her mother!  ; 0
(05/22 23:51:11)  Gondar: Or it's carving.
(05/22 23:51:16)  Ly'net: maybe
(05/22 23:51:17)  Michael Engberg: That's alright. 
(05/22 23:51:17)  Brayden: He's probably trapped too.
(05/22 23:51:20)  Kerryth: Or trying to help Rose.
(05/22 23:51:21)  Michael Engberg: It's normal. 
(05/22 23:51:30) To Sharaya: I heard that she had died earilier because they were saying that this might hurt Enberg more and someone said something about his wife
(05/22 23:51:50) To Sharaya: the bahro is scratching the rocks and enberg says that is normal
(05/22 23:51:56)  iami: are there any medics here for when Wheely is rescued?
(05/22 23:52:07)  Gondar: Assume they have trained staff up at the top.
(05/22 23:52:07)  [ Shadow ]: Free Wheely!
(05/22 23:52:14)  Travis Ohms: You have no reason to fear the Bahor, they have never done us harm
(05/22 23:52:18)  Wheely: I don't like it. 
(05/22 23:52:40)  Brayden: Maybe he's just as scared as you.
(05/22 23:52:53)  Travis Ohms: Did anyone else here that Bahro sound just now?
(05/22 23:52:55)  Michael Engberg: I know. But we've almost got a hole again. 
(05/22 23:52:57)  Ly'net: There is a medic in Uo
(05/22 23:52:59)  Gondar: no
(05/22 23:53:02)  Brayden: I heard it.
(05/22 23:53:03)  Tyion: i did travis
(05/22 23:53:09)  iami: ok, well I am a nurse if my services are needed
(05/22 23:53:11) To Sharaya: They almost have that hole reopened
(05/22 23:53:31)  Michael Engberg: We're making good progress. 
(05/22 23:53:48)  Wheely: Good. 
(05/22 23:53:48)  Ly'net: I have a little medical training, so I can help
(05/22 23:54:06)  Brayden: Hang in there, Wheely!
(05/22 23:54:23)  Wheely: It's moving around again dad. Like it was earlier. 
(05/22 23:54:42)  Wheely: And making noises. 
(05/22 23:54:55)  Michael Engberg: We've got a hole again. 
(05/22 23:55:02)  Wheely: I see!
(05/22 23:55:10) To Sharaya: wheely says its moving around and making strange noises like earlier
(05/22 23:55:12) Brayden cheers
(05/22 23:55:18)  Ly'net: Wheely, can you move your foot and toes on your hurt leg?
(05/22 23:55:23) To Sharaya: Enberg: We've got the hole again
(05/22 23:55:36) daht'ay cheers
(05/22 23:55:36)  daht'ay: light!
(05/22 23:55:46)  Michael Engberg: We're dropping down some water. 
(05/22 23:56:04)  Wheely: Okay, I'm not really thirsty though. 
(05/22 23:56:09) To Sharaya: they are dropping water down for her
(05/22 23:56:17) To Sharaya: but Wheely says shes fine
(05/22 23:56:20)  Michael Engberg: Just drink it babe. You need it. 
(05/22 23:56:39) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: they should also drop in salt tablets
(05/22 23:56:49)  Wheely: I can move my feet, yeah. It just hurts. 
(05/22 23:57:03) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: if shes dehydrated she will need to replace both the Liquid and The Saline
(05/22 23:57:07)  Michael Engberg: Is there anything else you need honey?
(05/22 23:57:19)  Wheely: It's moving a lot more, dad. 
(05/22 23:57:25)  Wheely: I just want to get out. 
(05/22 23:57:41)  Michael Engberg: I know babe. We're just about there. 
(05/22 23:57:43)  Brayden: He's probably just scared.
(05/22 23:57:52) To Sharaya: the bahro is moving more now
(05/22 23:58:07)  Michael Engberg: We'll have this hole big enough soon. 
(05/22 23:58:07) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: me thinks hes trapped too
(05/22 23:58:22) To Sharaya: thats my conclusion also
(05/22 23:58:24)  Brayden: maybe you should offer the bahro some water
(05/22 23:58:27)  Gondar: That's not a bad idea actually.
(05/22 23:58:32) To Sharaya: they are about there
(05/22 23:58:36) Ly'net nods her head
(05/22 23:58:45)  Travis Ohms: As a sign of friendship
(05/22 23:58:46)  Tyion: guys we dont even know if it is a bahro
(05/22 23:58:49)  Gondar: Though if it thinks the gesture is hostile... that's not good.
(05/22 23:58:59)  Wheely: It doesn't like when I draw symbols.
(05/22 23:59:00)  Ly'net: It's worth a try
(05/22 23:59:09)  Ly'net: Then don't
(05/22 23:59:18)  Wheely: It just erases them. 
(05/22 23:59:21)  [ Mister Cloak ]: if it's bottled, would it know what to do with it?
(05/22 23:59:22)  Tyion: wheely tell us dose it soud like a bahro by the sounds it makes.
(05/22 23:59:46)  Brayden: it must think you're trying to order it around...
(05/22 23:59:58)  Ly'net: can someone pass her a flashlight?
(05/23 00:00:05) To Sharaya: Wheely: It doenst like when I draw symbols
(05/23 00:00:11)  Brayden: don't want to scare it more
(05/23 00:00:13)  Travis Ohms: That might startle the Bahro
(05/23 00:00:13)  Brayden: with light
(05/23 00:00:17) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: so dont draw symbols!
(05/23 00:00:18) To Sharaya: Wheely: it just erases them
(05/23 00:00:23)  Tyion: true
(05/23 00:00:24)  Ly'net: oops
(05/23 00:00:25)  Ly'net: true
(05/23 00:00:35)  Tyion: it;s better to stay int he dark there almost there anyway
(05/23 00:00:35)  Dragonia: wheely, did you take a sip of the water?
(05/23 00:00:51)  Wheely: It's making those talking noises again dad. 
(05/23 00:01:04)  Michael Engberg: That's alright. 
(05/23 00:01:10)  Michael Engberg: It's normal. 
(05/23 00:01:24)  [ Mister Cloak ]: can you mimic what it's saying?
(05/23 00:01:25) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: if hes still in there then hes cut off from what ever power allows him to Link and Change Space And Time
(05/23 00:01:27)  Tyion: you'll be out soon Wheely just a little longer.
(05/23 00:01:38)  Wheely: Dad, I don't think it is. 
(05/23 00:01:54)  Gondar: ...hmm..
(05/23 00:01:54)  Brayden: try to stay calm
(05/23 00:02:05) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: she needs to leave him alone
(05/23 00:02:06) To Sharaya: I think the bahro caves are actually prisons thats why we were on the jouney
(05/23 00:02:25) To Sharaya: Wheely: Dad, I dont think it is Normal
(05/23 00:02:26)  Wheely: And it's moving a lot. I think it's nervous. 
(05/23 00:02:27)  Ly'net: Maybe it's trying to learn our language?
(05/23 00:02:39) To Sharaya: she thinks it is nervous
(05/23 00:02:39) From Randolf (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(05/23 00:02:40)  Michael Engberg: I'm sure it is. Just like you are. 
(05/23 00:02:42)  Gondar: Sounds like it's just nervous, wanting to get out.
(05/23 00:02:48) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: ya
(05/23 00:02:49) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: its stuck
(05/23 00:02:51)  Wheely: What if it's angry?
(05/23 00:02:52) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: its angry
(05/23 00:02:55) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: its Nervous
(05/23 00:03:02)  Michael Engberg: I'm sure it's just nervous?
(05/23 00:03:03)  Travis Ohms: It may try and run for the hole the moment its big enough, eager to get out
(05/23 00:03:15) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: and it could assume that her symbols are a Reminder of its enslavement
(05/23 00:03:16)  Michael Engberg: I don't think it's angry. 
(05/23 00:03:29)  Gondar: no idea why it'd be angry.
(05/23 00:03:30) To Sharaya: Wheely: What if its angry?
(05/23 00:03:32)  Michael Engberg: It has helped you. It won't be angry. 
(05/23 00:03:50) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: It Could be that the Fear the Creature has for Humans is the only thing keeping it from hurting her
(05/23 00:04:03) To Sharaya: Engberg: it might try to escape the moment the hole is big enough
(05/23 00:04:04)  Travis Ohms: It may be worried if the people coming are friendly or not, thats all
(05/23 00:04:09) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: it would be best not To Remind it of what it had to do
(05/23 00:04:11) Ly'net nods her head
(05/23 00:04:30)  Gondar: Better shout that..
(05/23 00:04:35)  Tyion: no voice chat
(05/23 00:04:36)  Ly'net: what was that?
(05/23 00:04:38) To Sharaya: Engberg: It has helped you. it wont be angry
(05/23 00:04:42)  Wheely: Ok dad.
(05/23 00:04:49) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: has she tried giving the blank book to the Bahro?
(05/23 00:04:56)  Tyion: everyone no voice chat it will cause people to crash
(05/23 00:05:09)  Ly'net: PLEASE! No more crashing.
(05/23 00:05:23) From Randolf in Randolf's Nexus: its not much but perhaps the offering would help calm it down
(05/23 00:05:26)  [ Shadow ]: Where are we at Michael?
(05/23 00:05:33)  dokaheid: sorry, rabbit on keyboard, that was the voicechat
(05/23 00:05:38) To Sharaya: I dont know
(05/23 00:05:39) From Randolf (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):  
(05/23 00:05:43) Ly'net roars with laughter
(05/23 00:05:51)  Tyion: lol it happens
(05/23 00:06:41)  Wheely: People are telling me to talk to the Bahro. I don't want to dad. It's moving and talking a lot now. 
(05/23 00:06:57)  Michael Engberg: You don't need to talk to it. There's no reason. 
(05/23 00:07:09)  Michael Engberg: Just focus on us. We're getting closer. 
(05/23 00:07:13)  Ly'net: It's probably nervous
(05/23 00:07:20) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: because if it helped her, she has likely only thanked it verbaly, it might not understand
(05/23 00:07:21)  Travis Ohms: Just give it its space, it may be nervious
(05/23 00:07:25)  Wheely: It's getting louder. 
(05/23 00:08:12) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: whoa, revelation, that could be why the linking book doesnt work, and why he hasent left yet
(05/23 00:08:13) From Sharaya in Eder Tsogal: Has it gone quiet?
(05/23 00:08:20) To Sharaya: Wheely: People are telling me to talk to the Bahro. I dont want to dad. Its moving more and taking alot now
(05/23 00:08:40) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: he is a "Free" bahro And it helped her, it expects something in return
(05/23 00:08:51) To Sharaya: Engberg/ You dont need to talk to it just focus on us we're getting closer
(05/23 00:09:00) To Sharaya: Wheely its getting louder
(05/23 00:09:18) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: She needs to give the Barho the Book!
(05/23 00:09:49) To Sharaya: I think the book was on a rope and they pulled it back but if not I would suggest it also
(05/23 00:10:04) From Randolf in *The Circle's Bevin: well, ask?
