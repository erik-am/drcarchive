(05/22 21:04:51) Nick White: Just one bend in the line.
(05/22 21:05:00) ireenquench: one zig zag?
(05/22 21:05:09) Nick White: Top is more toward the right and the bottom is more toward the left.
(05/22 21:05:12) Moiety Jean: I try to have an out of body experience for two minutes and you sneak in here
(05/22 21:05:20) Marck: Maybe it is more a wave than angular?
(05/22 21:05:21) Julian Lapis: We should be getting an onrush. Ye might wanna take a step back Chief. biggrin.gif
(05/22 21:05:25) Nick White: Yeah.
(05/22 21:05:28) Nick White: Kinda.
(05/22 21:05:36) ireenquench: thanks
(05/22 21:05:49) Moiety Jean: haha, vacate the landing point!
(05/22 21:05:56) Whilyam: Hello, Nick
(05/22 21:06:06) Whilyam: What's going on?
(05/22 21:06:06) Julian Lapis: Cy, you're glowing
(05/22 21:06:07) Marck sighs
(05/22 21:06:11) Cycreim: While we're waiting for people to filter in... Did anything happen when you touched the symbol in Negilahn, Nick?
(05/22 21:06:22) Nick White: Nope.
(05/22 21:06:22) Finn Dove: we were discussing that
(05/22 21:06:25) Nick White: Nothing.
(05/22 21:06:27) Moiety Jean dreams about leftover spaghetti
(05/22 21:06:40) Julian Lapis: Do you have any theories on it's nature, Nick?
(05/22 21:06:51) Julian Lapis: Grapevine reckons its some kind of ward.
(05/22 21:06:55) Nick White: It's nature?
(05/22 21:06:56) Finn Dove wonders why leftover spaghetti is better than a soft candybar
(05/22 21:07:06) Nick White: It's carved into a tree.
(05/22 21:07:29) ireenquench: sent it to you again Nick
(05/22 21:07:33) Deathsbedbug: Shorah
(05/22 21:07:38) Whilyam: --then you should know what "it's nature" means.
(05/22 21:07:45) Moiety Jean: Do you know anything about the Delin books?
(05/22 21:08:06) Cycreim: Yeah, the Delin books! Not really a priority right now but while we're waiting and all
(05/22 21:08:13) Cycreim: smile.gif
(05/22 21:08:16) Marck: The DRC and the ResEngs are already looking into the Delin book issue
(05/22 21:08:27) Moiety Jean: boy, it really doesn't take long for people to track you down. Explorers are as hard to get away from as mosquitos in the bushes.
(05/22 21:08:42) Cycreim: I wish people chased ME around everywhere sad.gif
(05/22 21:08:59) Moiety Jean: I chase you around everywhere. You're highly entertaining, Cyc.
(05/22 21:09:31) Nick White: Alright, let me get this out and I'll move along.
(05/22 21:09:37) Nick White: In Sharper's words....
(05/22 21:10:11) Eleri: shhhhhhh
(05/22 21:10:19) Moiety Jean: sorry.. we are in fact paying attention to you, Nick.
(05/22 21:10:30) Cycreim pays attention to Nick
(05/22 21:10:38) Nick White: "Peggy Sue is dead. It's dragging her and I'm following.
(05/22 21:10:52) Moiety Jean: The Urwin was named Peggy Sue?
(05/22 21:10:57) Eleri: (he named the Urwin Peggy Sue?!?)
(05/22 21:11:00) Whilyam: Peggy Sue being Urwin?
(05/22 21:11:02) Nick White: The hunter has become the hunted.
(05/22 21:11:27) Julian Lapis: He caught a look at the predator?
(05/22 21:11:29) Cycreim: Oh that's interesting. Wait, it's DRAGGING an Urwin???
(05/22 21:11:32) Kal: Ok, so he knows what it looks like?
(05/22 21:11:33) Moiety Jean: Did he say what it looked like?
(05/22 21:11:39) Finn Dove: did he get a picture?
(05/22 21:11:39) Nick White: "You'll never believe this."
(05/22 21:11:45) Cycreim: That thing must be huge!
(05/22 21:11:49) Moiety Jean: ::bounce::
(05/22 21:12:00) Kierra: interesting
(05/22 21:12:04) Cycreim: Or at least really strong...
(05/22 21:12:15) Nick White: "If you don't hear from me in a few hours you had better send someone to find my body. Ha!"
(05/22 21:12:20) Nick White: That's it.
(05/22 21:12:31) Nick White: That's the message.
(05/22 21:13:01) Nick White: Peggy Sue is obviously the Urwin.
(05/22 21:13:29) Nick White: That's all I know.
(05/22 21:13:40) Nick White: See you guys later.
