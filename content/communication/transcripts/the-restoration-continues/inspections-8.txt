(12/21 19:03:02) Brenda Rivera: But everything seems to be locked away.
(12/21 19:03:31) Tzalumen: Do you know why it's taking so long to recieve the message?

(12/21 19:04:24) Dr. Kodama: It's an error of some kind.
(12/21 19:04:29) Kato: New Books?! Where?!
(12/21 19:04:38) To Deg: he said new books hopefully soon !
(12/21 19:04:45) Tzalumen: It's just an error?
(12/21 19:04:50) Pete Miller: Does anyone here use voice chat? I'm trying to figure it out.
(12/21 19:04:52) Dr. Kodama: Yes.

(12/21 19:05:21) Kato: Thanks.
(12/21 19:05:22) Tzalumen: Have the Bahro cries been increasing in frequency?
(12/21 19:05:23) Dr. Kodama: The experience yesterday put things back a bit.
(12/21 19:05:29) Dr. Kodama: But we'll recover.
(12/21 19:05:42) Dr. Kodama: Sorry, two days ago - time is running together.
(12/21 19:05:55) Poutrew: Ah, those Bahro can be a bit persnikety, can't thay?
(12/21 19:06:00) Dr. Kodama: I don't believe the calls are increasing.
(12/21 19:06:01) Dr. Kodama: No.
(12/21 19:06:02) Kato: I agree with Tzalumen--it looks like the Bahro screams are happening more.
(12/21 19:06:06) quaywall: Has there been an explanation for the event?
(12/21 19:06:15) Dr. Kodama: Not yet.
(12/21 19:06:20) GaryWolf: can you elaborate on the ki message if you indeed know something about it please :)
(12/21 19:06:23) Kato: Better question: What do YOU think it was?
(12/21 19:06:37) To SuperGram: kodama at top of stairs
(12/21 19:06:53) To SuperGram: recording chat
(12/21 19:07:10) Dr. Kodama: I don't have any thoughts that haven't been expressed already.
(12/21 19:07:13) Erik: What's wrong with the fountains in the hoods by the way? I heard Mr. Engberg closed off the water.
(12/21 19:07:17) Thend: Hello all
(12/21 19:07:23) Kato: I noticed the fountains as well.
(12/21 19:07:31) Erik: Hi Thend

(12/21 19:08:30) SuperGram: Hi Becky
(12/21 19:08:32) Dr. Kodama: No Heek has bee removed. It's not working.
(12/21 19:08:39) Dr. Kodama: We're working on it.
(12/21 19:08:43) <sniffle> Jon Whitter is sad
(12/21 19:08:43) Dr. Kodama: Before we return it.
(12/21 19:08:59) Dr. Kodama: Games room will be a while.
(12/21 19:09:00) Kato: Seems like the scream affected most devices and services (KIs, water, etc.)
(12/21 19:09:05) GaryWolf: can you tell us which book(s) you might release first?
(12/21 19:09:12) Dr. Kodama: No, I can not.
(12/21 19:09:31) GaryWolf: Are you here to remove the barrier infront of you ?
(12/21 19:09:37) Tzalumen: can you tell us when the next message from the DRC will be?
(12/21 19:09:40) Dr. Kodama: No.
(12/21 19:09:46) Jon Whitter: What are you working on at the moment Dr Kodama?
(12/21 19:09:47) Dr. Kodama: Unfortunately.
(12/21 19:09:51) Kato: Do you have a timeframe on when this area of the City will be open to us?
(12/21 19:09:51) quaywall: Have you heard from Dr. Watson?
(12/21 19:09:53) Dr. Kodama: Ages.
(12/21 19:10:05) Dr. Kodama: Have not heard from Dr. Watson in a long tie.
(12/21 19:10:08) Dr. Kodama: time.
(12/21 19:10:23) GaryWolf: Have you been speaking to Victor Laxman, he was here yesterday?
(12/21 19:10:27) Jon Whitter: Do you know where he went?
(12/21 19:10:33) Dr. Kodama: I do not.
(12/21 19:10:34) Pete Miller: Who was just speaking aloud?
(12/21 19:10:42) Tzalumen: have you heard anything about the fireflies in Kemo?
(12/21 19:10:46) Thend: Do you know where Watson, Sharper, etc, went to? I mean, what was it like when you all disbanded?
(12/21 19:10:47) Dr. Kodama: Yes, I speak with Victor often.
(12/21 19:11:09) Dr. Kodama: Not especially interesting. We all left. It was not a happy time.
(12/21 19:11:40) Kato: Do you know about Sharper, then?
(12/21 19:11:45) Dr. Kodama: No.
(12/21 19:11:51) Jon Whitter: I'm shocked that Sharper did not stay behind and steal everthing
(12/21 19:11:57) Kato: LOL
(12/21 19:11:59) Jon Whitter: everything*
(12/21 19:12:00) Brenda Rivera: What new information do you have for us today?
(12/21 19:12:09) Nefret: let me ask, What do you know?
(12/21 19:12:13) Brenda Rivera: Or is this more or less a courtesy call?
(12/21 19:12:22) GaryWolf: Dr Kodama, how do you take your coffee?
(12/21 19:12:23) SuperGram: Sorry quaywall
(12/21 19:12:29) Dr. Kodama: The only new information is that things make take longer than you think.
(12/21 19:12:32) Dr. Kodama: Hello.
(12/21 19:12:33) SuperGram: Hi everyone
(12/21 19:12:40) Dr. Kodama: Black.
(12/21 19:12:45) Dr. Kodama: It's an error.
(12/21 19:12:48) Thend: Hmm. If this isn't too personal, there's been rumors about 'something' between you and Marie Sutherland, Doctor - Anthing to add to this?
(12/21 19:12:59) GaryWolf: lol
(12/21 19:13:01) Tzalumen: don't projects like this always take longer then you think?
(12/21 19:13:14) Dr. Kodama: No. And nothing to the rumors. She is not my type.
(12/21 19:13:21) Erik starts to laugh
(12/21 19:13:33) Jon Whitter: Playing hard to get
(12/21 19:13:43) Thend: Thank you, Doctor
(12/21 19:13:44) Brenda Rivera: I call dibs on the good Doctor. LOL

(12/21 19:13:56) Tzalumen: do you have a revised schedule yet?
(12/21 19:14:01) Dr. Kodama: Not sure I understand.
(12/21 19:14:10) quaywall: Any news of the d'ni survivor - is he still there?
(12/21 19:14:12) Dr. Kodama: No schedule yet. But I will push for one.
(12/21 19:14:17) Dr. Kodama: I always have.
(12/21 19:14:40) Kato: Er, Doctor, is there ANYTHING you can tell us today?
(12/21 19:14:47) Dr. Kodama: Yes.
(12/21 19:15:07) SuperGram: When does the DRC plan on opening the rest of the city?
(12/21 19:15:11) Oldman: shorah all
(12/21 19:15:14) Oldman waves
(12/21 19:15:15) Kato: Could you, uh, go ahead and tell us what that is?
(12/21 19:15:25) Brenda Rivera starts to laugh
(12/21 19:15:42) Tzalumen: does the DRC plan on eventually opening up the pub?
(12/21 19:15:47) Dr. Kodama: Depends on what you want it to be.
(12/21 19:15:52) Dr. Kodama: Yes.
(12/21 19:15:53) GaryWolf: good news :)
(12/21 19:15:54) Kato laughs
(12/21 19:15:55) Thend is still getting over Kodama saying 'Yes'
(12/21 19:16:01) Kato: Knew I wasn't gonna get anything out of that :P
(12/21 19:16:13) Dredisant: Oldman... your not supposed to be back there... its too dangerous
(12/21 19:16:32) Tzalumen: are we going to get working toilets any time soon?
(12/21 19:16:34) Dr. Kodama: Oldman, why are you there?
(12/21 19:16:40) Dr. Kodama: No.
(12/21 19:17:01) SuperGram: run Oldman
(12/21 19:17:03) Beefo la Rue : shorah

(12/21 19:17:51) TomahnaGuy: Please fill me in
(12/21 19:17:59) Dr. Kodama: Although, I wouldn't be surprised if at some point...
(12/21 19:18:13) TomahnaGuy: Are the barriers going to be lifted?
(12/21 19:18:19) 4runner: What news can you tell us
(12/21 19:18:22) Dr. Kodama: Currently no work is happening there.
(12/21 19:18:22) matt7188: i think that is just dangorus
(12/21 19:18:27) Thend: Doctor, why do you carry thaat pipe with you everywhere and do you ever actually smoke the thing?
(12/21 19:18:28) Dr. Kodama: What news do you want?
(12/21 19:18:32) Dr. Kodama: Yes.
(12/21 19:18:35) skylark:

(12/21 19:18:40) TomahnaGuy: When dr?
(12/21 19:18:48) Tzalumen: is it just me, or have the red lights on the pilliars on the bottom level brighter?
(12/21 19:18:51) Kato: What do you smoke?
(12/21 19:18:55) Dr. Kodama: When I'm not surrounded by people.
(12/21 19:18:57) 4runner: Any new's
(12/21 19:18:57) Dan'nee: Has there been any work lately on approving new Ages?
(12/21 19:19:00) Thend: Thanks, Doctor lol
(12/21 19:19:00) Dr. Kodama: Tobacco.
(12/21 19:19:05) TomahnaGuy: Does that meen today?
(12/21 19:19:06) Dr. Kodama: Yes.
(12/21 19:19:11) TomahnaGuy: Woot!
(12/21 19:19:21) Dr. Kodama: There has been quite a bit of work.
(12/21 19:19:22) TomahnaGuy: Seriously?
(12/21 19:19:27) Kato: Oh, also, is there any particular reason why the telescope (a mechanical device as far as I know) has been removed?
(12/21 19:19:28) matt7188: yeah
(12/21 19:19:33) Dan'nee: Or Eder Tsogahl?
(12/21 19:19:40) Erik: What happened to the fire-marbles in the neighborhoods, Dr. Kodama?
(12/21 19:19:48) TomahnaGuy: Dr laxman why have all the things been removed in the hood?
(12/21 19:20:06) TomahnaGuy: Or the bevins
(12/21 19:20:21) Dr. Kodama: We have removed certain items until we are certain they are working properly.
(12/21 19:20:22) Brenda Rivera: well, the Heek table is obvious , it needed repairs, the others...
(12/21 19:20:29) TomahnaGuy: Is the city sfe DrKodama?
(12/21 19:20:37) Dr. Kodama: The telescope...well it was best to have it gone for a while.
(12/21 19:20:45) Dr. Kodama: I assume the city is safe.
(12/21 19:20:45) TomahnaGuy: Why?
(12/21 19:20:48) Thend: Doctor, would you agree that the Event conditions (wiping all KI's, disabling marbles, imagers, and Heek) resemble something along the lines of a very strong Electro--Magnetic pulse?etc)
(12/21 19:20:52) Brenda Rivera: Hmm, maybe somethign you don't want us seeing?
(12/21 19:20:57) Kato: Don't want people spying on the City? ;)
(12/21 19:21:02) SuperGram: I think people are getting a bit antsy and want to explore
(12/21 19:21:05) Dr. Kodama: You've been watching LOST too much.
(12/21 19:21:06) Dan'nee: Becuase you don't want us seeing what you're working on?
(12/21 19:21:14) Thend laughs
(12/21 19:21:15) Kato laughs
(12/21 19:21:18) TomahnaGuy: Lol
(12/21 19:21:26) Brenda Rivera starts to laugh
(12/21 19:21:27) Kam Uraki: Ah, in other words we can't peep on the girls Bevins now Sad
(12/21 19:21:27) matt7188: lol
(12/21 19:21:28) Dan'nee: Are we expecting any other DRC visitors today?
(12/21 19:21:40) TomahnaGuy: Dr kodama are you opening the city now?
(12/21 19:22:02) Dr. Kodama: The city is probably safe but we do not work in probabilities.
(12/21 19:22:05) Jahuti: Barriers down now! Barriers down now!
(12/21 19:22:13) Thend: Doctor, good point, and many have been wondering also if you are actually IN LOST, as the person in the Dharma Foundation video - Is this true?
(12/21 19:22:14) TomahnaGuy: Where?
(12/21 19:22:14) Dr. Kodama: We need to make sure.
(12/21 19:22:17) Brenda Rivera sighs
(12/21 19:22:19) Erik: By the way, is Bevin just the D'ni word for Neigborhood, or does it mean something else?
(12/21 19:22:28) Dr. Kodama: We could.
(12/21 19:22:29) Kato: So, are you and your crew going to have to inspect the whole City before you open it?
(12/21 19:22:35) Dr. Kodama: Yes.
(12/21 19:22:45) TomahnaGuy: Dr kodama please allow us to access some city ares - just takotah
(12/21 19:22:46) J'ni: Dr, is anything ever certain? If so, what?
(12/21 19:22:48) Kam Uraki: lol, as though Kodama could wave his hand and the barriers would disappear with his devine powers
(12/21 19:22:48) Dan'nee: Why not let us help you check things out?
(12/21 19:22:52) Kato: Have you already inspected this area?
(12/21 19:22:52) Tzalumen: What happened to the guild of maintainers?
(12/21 19:22:54) Dr. Kodama: We are in the process of inspection already.
(12/21 19:23:09) Dan'nee: Give us some training and let us help out.
(12/21 19:23:09) TomahnaGuy: how long?
(12/21 19:23:11) SuperGram: I don't see any DRC in there obviously working
(12/21 19:23:14) TomahnaGuy: until the inspection is finsihed
(12/21 19:23:20) matt7188: or is there some secret that the DRC has about the baricaded areas
(12/21 19:23:29) Kam Uraki: The DRC have cloaking devices, SG
(12/21 19:23:48) SuperGram: hehe
(12/21 19:23:50) matt7188: lol
(12/21 19:23:51) Brenda Rivera chuckles
(12/21 19:23:51) TomahnaGuy: Dr Kodama when will the DRC site be updated and explorers allowed to acess eder delin and tsogahl again?
(12/21 19:23:52) SuperGram: I'd be willing to bet Kam
(12/21 19:23:52) Dr. Kodama: They are mostly inside.
(12/21 19:24:03) Dr. Kodama: In time.
(12/21 19:24:04) Thend: Doctor, in other words, do you moonlight with the Dharma Foundation?
(12/21 19:24:10) Dr. Kodama: No.
(12/21 19:24:13) Dredisant: Again!?
(12/21 19:24:18) Dr. Kodama: My brother.
(12/21 19:24:20) Kam Uraki: Inside in time? Existential answer Doc
(12/21 19:24:32) Thend: I see, thank you, Doctor, it explains a lot
(12/21 19:24:40) TomahnaGuy: Dr Kodama do you know where phil henderson or Dr watson is/ and we wont take no for an answe ;)
(12/21 19:24:46) Dr. Kodama: No.
(12/21 19:24:53) TomahnaGuy: hay!
(12/21 19:24:53) SuperGram: hehehe
(12/21 19:24:58) Erik: Nice try TG :)
(12/21 19:25:01) Dan'nee: I guess you should take that for an ansewr
(12/21 19:25:05) SuperGram laughs
(12/21 19:25:09) Kato: If he actually does not know, then he shouldn't be forced to answer ;)
(12/21 19:25:13) Thend: Folks seem real interested in Wat-man and the Phend-ster
(12/21 19:25:19) Jimbo: Well, well, if it aint Dr. Kodama!
(12/21 19:25:21) Dr. Kodama: I don't know where either of htem are.
(12/21 19:25:25) TomahnaGuy: Dr Kodama is it true some of the DRC have met the bahro?
(12/21 19:25:36) Dan'nee: Dr. forgive my ignorance, but what do you work on in the DRC exactly?
(12/21 19:25:46) Dr. Kodama: You can ask them. I never have.
(12/21 19:25:53) Kam Uraki: Dr. K. If you happen to have a prison book around, I could make a few folks disappear for you if you wanted... y'know... accidentally
(12/21 19:25:58) TomahnaGuy: have you met yeesha?
(12/21 19:26:01) GaryWolf: Dr do you think we should fear the Bahro at this point ?
(12/21 19:26:16) Dr. Kodama: I oversee Phase One and Phase Two Restoration work.
(12/21 19:26:23) Dan'nee: Ah, thanks
(12/21 19:26:33) SuperGram: Do you think We'll ever get to meet the Bahro?
(12/21 19:26:34) Thend: Kaaam lol
(12/21 19:26:40) Dr. Kodama: Early restoration - the first phases.
(12/21 19:26:41) TomahnaGuy: Dr Kodama what is there to hide int he library?
(12/21 19:26:45) Dr. Kodama: Nothing.
(12/21 19:26:48) Kam Uraki: Phase one is the risky part. Hope you use maintainer suits
(12/21 19:26:53) TomahnaGuy: then whyy not ope it?
(12/21 19:26:53) Dr. Kodama: Of course.
(12/21 19:26:54) Tzalumen: do you think the Bahro taste like chicken?
(12/21 19:26:55) TomahnaGuy: *open
(12/21 19:27:10) Dr. Kodama: I don't think a Bahro would let you eat it.
(12/21 19:27:18) Erik: TG, it has to be inspected after Tuesday's events
(12/21 19:27:26) SuperGram: I wouldn't want to eat them
(12/21 19:27:36) Dr. Kodama: I'm not sure.
(12/21 19:27:48) TomahnaGuy: Dr Kodama do you know how we were all mysteriously linked out yesterday?

(12/21 19:28:23) J'ni: Dr., do you feel that gatherings like this are closer to interrogations; or press conferences?
(12/21 19:28:32) Thend: Doctor, seeing as we are all on equal ground here - the explorers and the DRC - will you please institute a collective organizing body in Uru without the ob vious hierarchy at present
(12/21 19:28:33) Dan'nee: Do you know what the error is involved with?

(12/21 19:31:54) TomahnaGuy: anyone get a chatlog?
(12/21 19:31:57) Kato: What happened to Dr. K?!
(12/21 19:31:59) Dan'nee: I got some
(12/21 19:32:01) GaryWolf: he seems like a very serious guy
(12/21 19:32:05) 4runner: He only answers with yes and no
(12/21 19:32:06) Dan'nee: But I came in a few minutes late
(12/21 19:32:09) TomahnaGuy: hes an idiot
(12/21 19:32:13) Erik: Did he linked? Or... was he linked???
[Kodama linked out unexpectedly but reappeared]
(12/21 19:38:20) TomahnaGuy: a weel!
(12/21 19:38:23) TomahnaGuy: *wek
(12/21 19:38:24) quaywall: Fair enough - that's something to wrk with
(12/21 19:38:28) TomahnaGuy: *week
(12/21 19:38:29) Erik: Aw... I thought a few days!
(12/21 19:38:34) Dr. Kodama: But hopefully some other areas will be open sooner.
(12/21 19:38:36) Jon Whitter: Engberg is a slow worker
(12/21 19:38:37) Dan'nee: At least we know how much to wait
(12/21 19:38:40) Erik: But... I can live with that....
(12/21 19:38:45) TomahnaGuy: please persuade them to make it sooner dr
(12/21 19:38:47) Dr. Kodama: One other area at least.
(12/21 19:38:48) Raftel: People are already finding ways around these barrirers
(12/21 19:38:51) Dr. Kodama: I will try.
(12/21 19:38:59) Kato: Other areas of the City or entirely new areas to us?
(12/21 19:38:59) TomahnaGuy: ty
(12/21 19:39:00) Tzalumen: depending on your definition of a few, a week could be a few days
(12/21 19:39:02) Dr. Kodama: I understand it's frustrating.
(12/21 19:39:03) SuperGram: Tell them at least clean up the hoods
(12/21 19:39:05) TomahnaGuy thanks dr kodama
(12/21 19:39:11) TomahnaGuy: for trying
(12/21 19:39:16) Erik: thank you Doctor
(12/21 19:39:23) Firefly: What other area will be opened dr kodama
(12/21 19:39:24) TomahnaGuy: one final question....
(12/21 19:39:37) Dr. Kodama: Yes. One more.
(12/21 19:39:41) TomahnaGuy: when will we see the JaTaeri district?
(12/21 19:39:49) Dredisant: if Kodama needs permission from his superiors, then we will just wait... its not like Kodama doesnt want to let us into the rest of the city
(12/21 19:40:00) Dredisant: right?
(12/21 19:40:09) Dr. Kodama: Long time. It's still under my control and there is quite a bit of work needed on my team.
(12/21 19:40:18) TomahnaGuy: awww
(12/21 19:40:23) Thend: Doctor, upon what authority do you and the DRC make demands upon the explorers like this - to 'wait', and so forth?
(12/21 19:40:25) TomahnaGuy: whats coming soon then?
(12/21 19:40:26) Erik: So it's still in phase 1 or 2?
(12/21 19:40:33) Dan'nee: Thanks for answering all our questions.
(12/21 19:40:44) Dr. Kodama: Thend we control the barriers.
(12/21 19:40:52) Thend: Curses!
(12/21 19:40:56) SuperGram: :)
(12/21 19:40:57) TomahnaGuy: can u lift them for just tonight?
(12/21 19:40:58) Kato: Yes Doctor thank you for your time. Oh, if you can--will there be any more DRC staff here today?
(12/21 19:41:01) TomahnaGuy: because we like you
(12/21 19:41:02) Dr. Kodama: We control the Books.
(12/21 19:41:11) Dr. Kodama: I would watch how you talk.
(12/21 19:41:12) TomahnaGuy: u control everything
(12/21 19:41:13) SuperGram: Thanks for you patience with us Dr. K
(12/21 19:41:13) TomahnaGuy: we know
(12/21 19:41:16) Tzalumen: what kind of equipment are you using to make the repairs?
(12/21 19:41:25) Thend: One day, oh yes, one day, the EXPLORERS will control the barriers - mark my words!
(12/21 19:41:31) Dr. Kodama: I've been in a good mood lately for some reason.
(12/21 19:41:39) TomahnaGuy: really how odd
(12/21 19:41:42) GaryWolf: maybe its the coffee
(12/21 19:41:43) TomahnaGuy: :P
(12/21 19:41:46) Dredisant: good to hear Dr. K
(12/21 19:41:47) Matthew Miller: Well, it's good to be back in the cavern
(12/21 19:41:49) Kato: Maybe it's the pipe ;)
(12/21 19:41:50) Erik: Or the tobacco
(12/21 19:41:51) TomahnaGuy: or the new pipe stuff
(12/21 19:41:55) TomahnaGuy: hehe
(12/21 19:41:58) SuperGram: that must be an important clue to us
(12/21 19:41:59) TomahnaGuy: same thought patterns
(12/21 19:42:06) Dr. Kodama: Although comments like that wear on me.
