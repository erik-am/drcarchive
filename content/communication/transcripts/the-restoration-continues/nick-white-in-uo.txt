(12/27 18:30:22) Nick White: He's in the DRC hood.
(12/27 18:30:27) Vortmax: Ah, okay.
(12/27 18:30:43) Vortmax: So Nick, anything new and exciting you've been translating?
(12/27 18:31:21) Nick White: Not especially... I've been down here on and off
(12/27 18:31:38) Nick White: Helping out in other areas as well.
(12/27 18:31:42) Nick White: A little with Kodama.
(12/27 18:31:46) Nick White: That's been cool.
(12/27 18:31:54) Arthur Kalnins: Oh? With what?
(12/27 18:32:01) Nick White: Future stuff.
(12/27 18:32:10) Nick White: Kodama is early phase work so he gets there early.
(12/27 18:32:11) Arthur Kalnins starts to laugh
(12/27 18:32:11) Arthur Kalnins: That's pretty broad :P
(12/27 18:32:28) Nick White: What do you want to know?
(12/27 18:32:42) Nick White: I've been to two Ages pretty recently...one doesn't even have a name yet.
(12/27 18:32:55) Nick White: Real early.
(12/27 18:32:57) Vortmax: Ooooh, fun
(12/27 18:32:58) ireenquench: I have always wanted to ask you about the two Shomat story versions... how many other sources did you use for the history version... and why does it leave out the Genocide?
(12/27 18:33:05) Arthur Kalnins: Oh? What are they?
(12/27 18:33:30) Nick White: Can't say. It's gotten a bit stricter since I've been back.
(12/27 18:33:39) Nick White: Remind me of the Shomat stories...the King?
(12/27 18:33:43) Arthur Kalnins: Okay.
(12/27 18:33:51) Arthur Kalnins: King Shomat
(12/27 18:33:57) Nick White: Two versions?
(12/27 18:34:21) Nick White: That was a long time ago but I'm trying to remember.
(12/27 18:34:27) Nick White: We use lots of stuff for those summaries.
(12/27 18:34:33) Arthur Kalnins: I've seen two. One on the Tokotah and one in Eder Kemo.
(12/27 18:34:35) Tweek: perhaps he is refering to the one thats in Kemo and the other book which is on the Tokotah II roof
(12/27 18:34:49) Arthur Kalnins: I didn't know there was a difference.
(12/27 18:35:10) Nick White: I don't think I did two summaries though.
(12/27 18:35:11) ireenquench: Shomat was the King who supposedly kiled an indigenous race in a garden age... the one version states that...but it is more in afairy tale style...the latter version...also written by you.... leaves that out.
(12/27 18:35:35) Nick White: Ah right, that's from one of the Holy Books
(12/27 18:35:38) Tweek: Arthur one is a journal roughly about shomats reign, the other is about a specific event
(12/27 18:35:41) Nick White: The other is more of a historical summation
(12/27 18:35:45) Arthur Kalnins: Ah, okay
(12/27 18:35:49) Arthur Kalnins: Now I understand.
(12/27 18:35:54) Nick White: I think.
(12/27 18:36:04) ireenquench: Holy books????
(12/27 18:36:17) Nick White: Yeah.
(12/27 18:36:17) Tweek: Hey Nick, do you happen to know where our Great Tree jackets are?
(12/27 18:36:48) Nick White: Don't know.
(12/27 18:36:53) Nick White: About jackets.
(12/27 18:36:58) Tweek: ok thanks
(12/27 18:37:14) ireenquench: What are the holy books about? Are they going to be acessible to explorers?
(12/27 18:37:49) Nick White: There are a lot.
(12/27 18:38:03) Nick White: The D'ni didn't have one special holy book but considered quite a few
(12/27 18:38:27) Nick White: The Regeltavok Oorpah is the oldest I think
(12/27 18:38:48) Vortmax: What do they cover? History, or religion, or what?
(12/27 18:39:05) Arthur Kalnins: What does that mean? Regeltavok Oorpah?
(12/27 18:39:17) Nick White: Right, as well as other stuff.
(12/27 18:39:26) Nick White: It's not all prophecies.
(12/27 18:39:48) Nick White: Book of Oorpah basically
(12/27 18:39:59) Nick White: Oorpah was a prophet from Garternay
(12/27 18:39:59) Vortmax: Oorpah was a person?
(12/27 18:40:01) Arthur Kalnins: Ah. Makes sense
(12/27 18:40:09) Vortmax: Oooh, so it must be a REALLY old book!
(12/27 18:40:19) Nick White: Yeah I don't think we have the original. : )
(12/27 18:40:21) Thend: Oprah is famous, Vort, surprised you haven't heard of her
(12/27 18:40:27) Nick White: Ha
(12/27 18:40:29) Arthur Kalnins: Sort of like the old testament?
(12/27 18:40:31) Nick White: Nice one.
(12/27 18:40:47) Vortmax starts to laugh
(12/27 18:40:48) Nick White: Not sure it works like that.
(12/27 18:41:07) Nick White: That Book and one of the Great King were some of the oldest and the most read probably but they had more
(12/27 18:41:29) Nick White: Tevahr seemed to be a newer writer who was pretty popular too.
(12/27 18:41:38) ireenquench: From Garternay, cool. Is it in D'ni? Or some older language, like Pre-D'ni?
(12/27 18:41:58) Tweek: have you done any research into the exodus from Garternay? Cause I have a theory that the Ronay split off into 5 groups
(12/27 18:42:20) Nick White: It's still D'ni - a little older version which makes it a bit harder
(12/27 18:42:39) Vortmax: Nick, have you found any novels, fiction books?
(12/27 18:42:43) Nick White: Could be. I haven't heard that rumor.
(12/27 18:42:50) Nick White: Yeah
(12/27 18:43:21) Leonor: Is History easy to tell from fiction? Any chance there could be a confusion?
(12/27 18:43:26) Thend: Nick, are you going to read any D'ni stuff for Spoken Word Night tonight?
(12/27 18:43:27) Nick White: I"m sure.
(12/27 18:43:32) Nick White: This isn't a perfect science.
(12/27 18:43:42) Nick White: Uh, no...
(12/27 18:43:50) Nick White: I don't know what Spoken word is...
(12/27 18:43:55) Nick White: And I do have work to do.
(12/27 18:44:18) Nick White: Things have gotten a little more strict, like I said.
(12/27 18:44:21) Arthur Kalnins: Heh... We'll still need to get you as a celebrity SWN guest.
(12/27 18:44:33) Vortmax: Nick: SWN = Spoken Word Night
(12/27 18:44:35) Nick White: Cool.
(12/27 18:44:54) Arthur Kalnins: Might be nice to see what the D'ni could offer.
(12/27 18:45:02) Nick White: I don't speak it very well...
(12/27 18:45:24) Nick White: You probably speak it better than me.
(12/27 18:45:29) ireenquench: Nick, you can't talk freely about your work? Why not? Does it involve the world formula? ;)
(12/27 18:45:41) Nick White: We have rules.
(12/27 18:45:50) Nick White: formula?
(12/27 18:46:07) Nick White: No, just that things are starting to run a little more like a business now.
(12/27 18:46:14) Nick White: With Cate involved.
(12/27 18:46:19) Arthur Kalnins: Cate?
(12/27 18:46:21) Vortmax: That name again. Who is Cate??
(12/27 18:46:22) Tweek: who is Cate?
(12/27 18:46:23) Thend: Who's Cate?
(12/27 18:46:30) Vortmax: Kodama mentioned her once before.
(12/27 18:46:35) Dan'ni: Let me guess - Cate is the main decision maker now?
(12/27 18:46:37) Arthur Kalnins: Kodama was meeting with a Cate. Who is she?
(12/27 18:46:40) Nick White: Uh...you'll find out.
(12/27 18:46:40) ireenquench: Cate is all into being hush hush?
(12/27 18:46:44) Thend: or, to put it another way, Who's Cate?
(12/27 18:46:48) Nick White: I think there's an announcement of some kind coming...
(12/27 18:46:49) Vortmax: Of course.
(12/27 18:47:08) Nick White: Blake is a friend of Cate's...I think.
(12/27 18:47:10) Arthur Kalnins: And will we see this Cate?
(12/27 18:47:14) Nick White: Oh yeah.
(12/27 18:47:25) Arthur Kalnins: Ah... is that a good thing or bad?
(12/27 18:47:31) Dan'ni: I just had a chat with Engberg and he said that things are not just DRC's decisions. So I suspect this Cate might be the one who pulls the strings? :)
(12/27 18:47:34) Vortmax: So Cate is connected to Turner as well? We know they're funding you guys this time. :D
(12/27 18:47:34) Nick White: She's cool - I like her.
(12/27 18:47:44) Arthur Kalnins: Yet she's strict?
(12/27 18:47:50) Arthur Kalnins: I'm not sure I like her..
(12/27 18:47:57) Arthur Kalnins: If she's restricting you guys
(12/27 18:47:59) Nick White: Well... Cate doesn't work for Turner.
(12/27 18:48:12) Nick White: And I'm not sure the - alright, I'm done.
(12/27 18:48:19) Nick White: Gotta be careful here.
(12/27 18:48:28) Nick White: I'll let her explain everything.
(12/27 18:48:45) Arthur Kalnins: Hmm..Let Cate know she needs to be less strict, Nick... you remember what happened the last time..
(12/27 18:48:46) Nick White: Well, I know this stuff will be all over the boards so it's not very private.
(12/27 18:48:47) Frolain: when should we expect an announcement then?
(12/27 18:49:09) gelf56: i just gota know do kate a sawyer get away!?
(12/27 18:49:19) Nick White: Dude, I love LOST.
(12/27 18:49:28) Nick White: I wish it was that Cate.... : )
(12/27 18:49:37) Nick White: she's not though....
(12/27 18:49:52) Nick White: A bit older...
(12/27 18:49:55) Vortmax: Ooooh, I've got this theory that Dr. K was playing the Dharma guy (from the instruction videos) while he was on the surface
(12/27 18:49:56) Nick White: : )
(12/27 18:50:04) Nick White: That was his brother...
(12/27 18:50:06) Nick White: : )
(12/27 18:50:16) Arthur Kalnins: Mark Kodama? :P
(12/27 18:50:28) Vortmax: Seriously, I've got a picture somewhere comparing the two. It explains a lot if they're brothers.
(12/27 18:50:30) Nick White: That's a fun joke around the DRC...
(12/27 18:50:44) Nick White: He does have a brother but I don't think that's him
(12/27 18:50:52) Nick White: Uh, yes, she will read the boards.
(12/27 18:51:05) Nick White: Alright, well I suppose I should get going...
(12/27 18:51:09) Nick White: Been fun guys.
(12/27 18:51:18) Nick White: I'll see you around.
(12/27 18:51:22) Dan'ni: Thanks for stopping Nick. Say hi to Cate from us.
(12/27 18:51:24) Nick White waves
(12/27 18:51:29) Dan'ni: Tell her we're watching. And waiting.
(12/27 18:51:33) Arthur Kalnins: Find someone to leak stuff to! :P
(12/27 18:51:44) Nick White: You can tell her yourself when you see her.
