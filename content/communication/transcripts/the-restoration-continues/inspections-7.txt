(12/20 14:28:35) Marie Sutherland: Hello, Ural
(12/20 14:28:41) Ural: Hi
(12/20 14:28:58) Ural: Any idea whats happening?
(12/20 14:29:16) Marie Sutherland: Just taking a quick look through the neighborhoods, at the moment.
(12/20 14:29:27) Lial: Hello, Marie
(12/20 14:29:37) Ural: What happened to the water in fountains?
(12/20 14:29:41) Marie Sutherland: How are things here?
(12/20 14:29:51) Ural: Not too good..
(12/20 14:30:09) Marie Sutherland: There was a problem with the fountains in several of the neighborhoods...
(12/20 14:30:16) Ural: No comunuty room access
(12/20 14:30:23) Ural: Hmm
(12/20 14:30:31) Marie Sutherland: So Engberg has turned the water to the fountains off for a while.
(12/20 14:30:41) Ural: K
(12/20 14:30:50) Marie Sutherland waves
(12/20 14:30:57) Lial waves
(12/20 14:31:00) Ural: Ki's been a little wonky..
(12/20 14:31:33) Marie Sutherland: Engberg is mainly focusing on structural problems.
(12/20 14:31:38) Ural: Relot book sharing too..
(12/20 14:31:43) Ural: K
(12/20 14:31:57) Lial: I hope the fountain problem turns out to be a minor one
(12/20 14:31:59) Marie Sutherland: I think Laxman is looking into issues with the KI and the lattice.
(12/20 14:32:32) Ural: K
(12/20 14:32:34) Lial: The three of you must be very busy.
(12/20 14:32:45) Lial: Do you have any assistants?
(12/20 14:32:58) Lial: Or will we be your assistants?
(12/20 14:32:58) Marie Sutherland: My main concern has been about the explorers. I was concerned that some haven't been heard from since...
(12/20 14:33:23) Marie Sutherland: everyone was suddenly linked to their own Reltos.
(12/20 14:33:30) Ural: Yes
(12/20 14:33:54) Marie Sutherland: So far, no one I've talked to has heard of anyone missing, so I'm feeling a little better about that.
(12/20 14:34:03) Ural: Good!
(12/20 14:34:12) Lial: I heard the reports, but wasn't in the cavern at the time.
(12/20 14:34:33) Lial: I think all of my friends are accounted for. Good to hear it was just a scare, though.
(12/20 14:34:56) Marie Sutherland: Lial, we do have a handful of assistants, but we can use all the help we can get. :D
(12/20 14:35:29) Lial: I'm sure all of the Greeters are ready to help all they can.
(12/20 14:35:35) Marie Sutherland: Our assistants will mainly make themselves available in "A Beginner's Hood".
(12/20 14:35:50) Ural: Good!
(12/20 14:35:55) Lial: How will Beginner's Hoods be identified?
(12/20 14:35:56) Marie Sutherland: But they are referring people to the Guild of Greeters for further assistance.
(12/20 14:36:08) Ural: Great!
(12/20 14:36:54) Ural: Notice some hood dup in nexus list?
(12/20 14:36:54) Marie Sutherland: Other than the KI and book sharing problems, are things going well here?
(12/20 14:37:02) Ural: Yes
(12/20 14:37:21) Marie Sutherland: Yes, Laxman is looking into the duplicate hoods, too.
(12/20 14:38:08) Lial: I need to finish transcribing information that was lost with the old KIs.
(12/20 14:38:15) Lial: Nice meeting you, Marie.
(12/20 14:38:18) Lial waves
(12/20 14:38:26) Marie Sutherland: It's very nice to meet you, too.
(12/20 14:38:31) Ural: Do stop bu again
(12/20 14:38:35) Marie Sutherland: I should continue making the rounds.
(12/20 14:38:43) Ural: And nice meetting you
(12/20 14:38:43) Lial (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(12/20 14:38:44) Marie Sutherland: I like your shirt, Ural. :D
(12/20 14:38:50) Ural: Thanks!
