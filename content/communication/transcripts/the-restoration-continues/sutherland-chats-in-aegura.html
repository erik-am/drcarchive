(12/28 16:37:09) Butch starts to laugh
(12/28 16:37:13) Andrej cheers
(12/28 16:37:30) Dan'nee: Is this visit for an announcement, Dr. Sutherlan, or just a chat?
(12/28 16:37:40) SixEcho: argg - when are they going to open up more?
(12/28 16:38:04) Butch: Marie Sutherland, Au'gura 2006-Dec-28
(12/28 16:38:17) Marie Sutherland: Dan'nee, a little of both, I guess.
(12/28 16:38:23) Dan'nee: Great!
(12/28 16:38:33) Andrej: Nice!
(12/28 16:38:34) Lan: c
(12/28 16:38:37) Lan: cool
(12/28 16:38:38) Matthew Miller: Marie, who is this Cate person we have heard about from other DRC members?
(12/28 16:39:06) Dan'nee waits to see if she'll actually answer that.
(12/28 16:39:26) Lan: I think most of us want to hear the annoucement first :)
(12/28 16:39:38) Andrej waits for the anouncement
(12/28 16:39:44) Marie Sutherland: Cate would probably prefer to introduce herself.
(12/28 16:39:57) Thend: figured. When?
(12/28 16:40:04) SixEcho: sighs, is this all?
(12/28 16:40:15) Dan'nee: Patience, SixEcho
(12/28 16:40:25) Storyteller: An impatient lot, aren't we?
(12/28 16:40:34) Thend nods his head
(12/28 16:40:45) SixEcho: it's been 6-9 months
(12/28 16:40:49) Jared: We have exploration in our blood, what can I say
(12/28 16:40:58) Butch: Does Cate plan on introducing herself soon?
(12/28 16:40:59) Dan'nee: Should we wait until after the announcement before we ask questions?
(12/28 16:41:10) Grogyan: When will we see the new story?
(12/28 16:41:14) Lan: I think we should Dan'nee
(12/28 16:41:16) Matthew Miller: Yeah, sorry. Maybe I should have waited until after the announcment
(12/28 16:41:24) Jared: Grogyan, this is part of it
(12/28 16:41:31) SixEcho: twitchie: i've finished the game a few times hoping it unlocked more content, only to get reset later
(12/28 16:41:51) Camann: Please, everyone hold questions until after Marie's announcement
(12/28 16:41:51) Marie Sutherland: When, I'm not sure when Cate will be here. Probably not until after the new year.
(12/28 16:42:18) Matthew Miller: Could you say anything about her position within the drc? We hardly know anything about her
(12/28 16:42:42) Thanakar: why is everyoen up here?
(12/28 16:43:02) Dan'nee: I personally have a theory about who she is that I'm waiting to meet her to see if it's true.
(12/28 16:43:02) SixEcho: did i just happen upon a scheduled announcement? time? (almost 4pm CST here)
(12/28 16:43:07) Error: Don't know how to '/whisper Thanakar Maries's over the barrier'
(12/28 16:43:37) Thend: We are listening to Marie Sutherland's impromptu announcement
(12/28 16:43:38) SixEcho: *hears nothing*
(12/28 16:43:41) Lan: Dr. Sutherland already said she would like to introduce herself, so that will be explained during her introduction
(12/28 16:44:04) Marie Sutherland: as for the announcements... Engberg has moved his focus onto the fountains in the hoods.
(12/28 16:44:12) Arrhae cheers
(12/28 16:44:13) zia cheers
(12/28 16:44:15) tikibear: I suppose it will be better than the Rand imposter we saw earlier today.
(12/28 16:44:16) Thend starts to laugh
(12/28 16:44:16) Lan cheers
(12/28 16:44:17) Grogyan cheers
(12/28 16:44:22) Camann: That's wonderful news!
(12/28 16:44:23) Dan'nee: She's at the top of the stairs
(12/28 16:44:25) Storyteller: Alright! I can break out the swim trunks!
(12/28 16:45:04) a'bond claps his hands
(12/28 16:45:04) Andrej: SixEcho, please be patient, Mrs. Sutherland can't answer to everyabody and I think that she is ovverrun with questions
(12/28 16:45:04) Thend: Marie, about the Hoods, who took the ttelescopes and who put them back? It was reported they simply 'blinked' back in
(12/28 16:45:09) Marie Sutherland: I think he'll get them working again very soon. Maybe even today, though don't hold him to that. :D
(12/28 16:45:24) Andrej: Thend My Hodd doesn't have the telesope back, yet
(12/28 16:45:25) Matthew Miller: Oh, today. That would be nice!
(12/28 16:45:28) Lan cheers
(12/28 16:46:14) Marie Sutherland: After the fountain, we'll be focusing on the community rooms in the neighborhoods.
(12/28 16:46:36) a'bond: cool
(12/28 16:46:37) Andrej: That sounds great, Marie!
(12/28 16:46:43) Marie Sutherland: We hope that those will also be available in the next few days.
(12/28 16:46:50) Matthew Miller cheers
(12/28 16:46:53) Aleks: Sounds great.
(12/28 16:47:29) Andrej: Will Ae'gura be only opened, after the hoods are fully functional?
(12/28 16:47:30) Aleks: How about the schedule for the city? Anything tentatively known yet?
(12/28 16:47:38) Jared: can you give us any specifics on why they were gone in the first place?
(12/28 16:47:47) Dahn: Great to hear! I hope that heavy heek table will be soon to follow
(12/28 16:48:28) Marie Sutherland: Andrej, we are still evaluating the different areas of the city.
(12/28 16:48:48) Dan'nee: Which area looks most promising?
(12/28 16:48:55) Aleks: Any areas we are likely to see sooner than others?
(12/28 16:48:58) Andrej: Thx, I hope to see more of the city, soon!
(12/28 16:49:12) Jimbo: Whats there to evalue?
(12/28 16:50:05) SixEcho: Jimbo, how about the lag....
(12/28 16:50:18) Marie Sutherland: Aleks, the areas that were open prior to "the scream" will likely be opened first.
(12/28 16:50:36) Jimbo: a loose tile we might fall over?
(12/28 16:50:59) Aleks: Ah, ok? So the Takotah and such?
(12/28 16:51:09) Aleks: Sounds good.
(12/28 16:51:10) Andrej: Well... I didn't manage to read through all the books in the King's hall, so I'm thursting for information!
(12/28 16:51:56) Jimbo: But u do look great, Dr. Sutherland
(12/28 16:52:01) Andrej: This will be hopefully one of the first Areas to be opened
(12/28 16:52:17) Dan'nee: Do you know of any D'ni history that will be released soon?
(12/28 16:52:26) Dan'nee: I noticed Nick White is back, for translations?
(12/28 16:52:34) Marie Sutherland: Thanks, Jimbo.
(12/28 16:52:37) Aleks: Any word on any ages? I know it may be early to speak of it, and all.
(12/28 16:52:44) Grogyan: How is Dr Laxman going with the Great Zero?
(12/28 16:53:22) Marie Sutherland: Dan'nee, for now the priority is getting things that were recently closed verified and opened again.
(12/28 16:54:00) Dan'nee: What kind of work is Nick doing, then?
(12/28 16:54:26) SixEcho: i'm gonna check out the new content in the "Life Age" *links via X in the lower right of screen*
(12/28 16:55:02) Marie Sutherland: Aleks, there are two Ages you've probably heard about that will be opening in the not too distant future.
(12/28 16:55:37) Aleks: Ah, ok. I think I know what you mean. Quite exciting.
(12/28 16:55:42) Butch: Dr. Sutherland, is there anything the explorer community can do to help the DRC?
(12/28 16:56:02) Montgomery: Dr. Sutherland, have any explorers visited either of these ages, or are they completely new?
(12/28 16:56:26) Marie Sutherland: grogyan, Laxman is busy with lattice issues at the moment, but I think he hopes to get back to the Great Zero after that.
(12/28 16:56:54) Grogyan: Great thanks Dr.
(12/28 16:56:58) Matthew Miller: Does he have any information on that interesting readings from before the scream?
(12/28 16:57:36) Marie Sutherland: Butch, at the moment, your patience and support are helping us tremendously.
(12/28 16:57:47) Aleks: And as for the scream, is there any more info regarding its exact origin?
(12/28 16:57:59) Aleks: Was it a Bahro thing for sure?
(12/28 16:58:42) jerrabella: G
(12/28 16:58:42) Marie Sutherland: I also know that Laxman has mentioned something that he wanted help looking in to.
(12/28 16:58:44) a'bond: Is Douglas Sharper still around?
(12/28 16:59:17) Dan'nee: He mentioned the city book and "instancing"
(12/28 16:59:20) Marie Sutherland: Matthew, I'm sorry, but you'll have to ask him that.
(12/28 16:59:34) Dan'nee: Many think the instancing is based on Neighborhoods
(12/28 16:59:35) Montgomery: How can we help Dr. Laxman?
(12/28 16:59:50) Dan'nee: That the book brings you to a Neighborhood instance of the city
(12/28 17:00:04) Thend: Marie, anthropologically speaking, there's the possibility that the 'Called' may, in actuality, be descendents of genuine D'ni. I request you authorize blood tests of both the D'ni survivor and willing members of the explorer community to confirm this? What is your stance on this possible scheme?
(12/28 17:00:36) Dan'nee: vid has achart on the drc site, I believe
(12/28 17:02:11) Marie Sutherland: thend, That's an interesting theory.
(12/28 17:02:24) Mookie: Hey vid, whatcha up to?
(12/28 17:02:29) Mookie: mt
(12/28 17:02:50) Thend: It seems to be scientifically proveable
(12/28 17:03:01) Mookie: Hey vid, whatca up to?
(12/28 17:03:05) Mookie: Fark
(12/28 17:03:07) Montgomery: Dr. Sutherland, are the two ages you mentioned new, or have explorers visited them in the past?
(12/28 17:03:07) Matthew Miller: Marie, what have you been working on lately yourself?
(12/28 17:03:11) Marie Sutherland: I'm sory to cut this chat short, but I have another meeting to attend.
(12/28 17:03:20) jerrabella: Lol
(12/28 17:03:23) Mark_AF: Well you can start by eliminating everyone that is not native american.
(12/28 17:03:32) Matthew Miller: Okay, thank you for coming Dr.Sutherland.
