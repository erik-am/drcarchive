(12/29 13:53:09) BrettM: Good afternoon, Dr. Kodama.
(12/29 13:53:31) Dr. Kodama: Hello.
(12/29 13:53:47) BrettM: Is there anything I can help you with?
[Note: Jacky tells Dr. Kodama he reminds her of a real doctor.]
(12/29 13:54:08) Dr. Kodama: Of a what?
(12/29 13:54:17) Dalken Starbyne: Shorah!
(12/29 13:54:17) Dr. Kodama: Ah...
(12/29 13:54:24) Dr. Kodama: I am a real doctor.
(12/29 13:54:28) BrettM laughs
[Note: Jacky asks Dr. Kodama if he would like to play school.]
(12/29 13:54:29) Dr. Kodama: No thank you.
(12/29 13:54:43) Matthew Allen: Greetings Doctor
(12/29 13:54:50) Dr. Kodama: Hello.
(12/29 13:54:55) Matthew Allen: so what are you a doctor of, since you're a real doc?
(12/29 13:55:09) Dr. Kodama: Geology
(12/29 13:55:18) BrettM: Do we have you to thank for the return of the scopes?
(12/29 13:55:32) Dalken Starbyne: Hey, just wondering...did you need help with anything at the moment?
(12/29 13:57:32) Matthew Allen: So what brings you here today, Doctor?
[Note: Dr. Kodama wanders the hood for a time, not speaking. He ends up on the Community Room balcony. Some other explorers follow him over the barricade at the stairs.]
(12/29 13:59:16) Dr. Kodama: What are you doing up here?
(12/29 13:59:23) Matthew Allen: looking for you :)
(12/29 13:59:34) Dr. Kodama: Ah, just checking the community center - shoud open today.
(12/29 13:59:43) Matthew Allen: oh really? That's great news!
(12/29 13:59:44) vid: That's great news!
(12/29 13:59:51) Dr. Kodama: Yes, about time, huh?
(12/29 13:59:51) Strider: Woo hoo
(12/29 13:59:58) Loriendil: Very nice!
(12/29 14:00:03) vid: That means Spoken Word Night won't be in that cramped classroom next week... thanks so much, Dr. Kodama!
(12/29 14:00:16) Dr. Kodama: I also think Laxman is going to try to get Heek tables in here today.
(12/29 14:00:17) Matthew Allen: so was it determined if the incident surrounding the bahro scream caused any damage to it, since that's where the town hall was?
(12/29 14:00:20) BrettM: Yes, much appreciated!
(12/29 14:00:31) Matthew Allen: And heek tables! Quite a day
(12/29 14:00:34) Dr. Kodama: Not sure they are working correctly but we're putting them back regardless...
(12/29 14:00:48) Dr. Kodama: No new damage that we could find.
(12/29 14:00:50) Loriendil: Ahh, well, the tables are good for dancing on if nothing else..
(12/29 14:00:50) vid: They'd probably work better if people danced on them less.
(12/29 14:01:03) BrettM: Can you comment on the behavior of the scopes now?
(12/29 14:01:15) Dr. Kodama: I've heard they are having problems.
(12/29 14:01:28) Arthur Kalnins: Problems?
(12/29 14:01:37) BrettM: Any idea why? Some kind of damage?
(12/29 14:01:38) Dr. Kodama: Am I wrong?
(12/29 14:01:42) Dr. Kodama: Not sure.
(12/29 14:01:49) Dr. Kodama: Fortunately, not my area.
(12/29 14:01:51) BrettM: No, sir, you are not wrong!
(12/29 14:02:02) BrettM: Mr. Laxman, then?
(12/29 14:02:19) Dr. Kodama: He would know more than myself in regards to the telescopes.
(12/29 14:02:24) BrettM: Thank you.
(12/29 14:02:33) Matthew Allen: So is there any sort of timetable right now for what areas of the city are going to be cleared? Takotah? Hall of Kings?
(12/29 14:02:33) vid: Dr. Kodama, can you make a comment about the "instancing" that is occuring? It's making life very difficult recently, even with several o f us trying to chart it all out.
(12/29 14:02:53) Dr. Kodama: No official timetable yet.
(12/29 14:03:01) Dr. Kodama: The instancing is confusing.
(12/29 14:03:16) Matthew Allen: Now there's an understatement...
(12/29 14:03:17) Dr. Kodama: Not sure we completely understand it either - or at leat myself.
(12/29 14:03:18) Arthur Kalnins: Can we expect to see the DRC more often now than before or is this sort of a reaction to the 19th's scream?
(12/29 14:03:29) Dr. Kodama: It's not what I like to deal with - unscientific.
(12/29 14:03:44) Dr. Kodama: I'll leave the magial solutions to someone else.
(12/29 14:03:55) vid: It's probably very scientific... we just don't know how to explain it yet. But we're certainly doing our best.
(12/29 14:04:05) Dr. Kodama: I'm not sure it is.
(12/29 14:04:23) Arthur Kalnins: Is the DRC going to continue removing the stones and pages, etc.?
(12/29 14:04:27) vid: Everything is scientific on some level. It's just a matter of understanding everything involved.
(12/29 14:04:35) Dr. Kodama: Perhaps.
(12/29 14:04:54) BrettM: Dr. Kodama, which of the DRC is most involved with historical translations?
(12/29 14:04:56) Dr. Kodama: No, we won't be removing stones, pages... we aren't the ones who put them out in the first place.
(12/29 14:05:04) Arthur Kalnins: Okay.
(12/29 14:05:08) Dr. Kodama: Dr. Watson.
(12/29 14:05:20) Arthur Kalnins: Dr. Watson?
(12/29 14:05:22) Dr. Kodama: I'm sorry to be so quick but I do have a meeting to attend to in the city.
(12/29 14:05:24) Matthew Allen: Who is doing the work in Dr. Watson's absence though, if anyone?
(12/29 14:05:26) BrettM: Hmmm, he might be a little difficult to consult these days!
(12/29 14:05:32) Loriendil: Is Dr. Watson back?
(12/29 14:05:36) Dr. Kodama: Nick knows quite a bit if you see him.
(12/29 14:05:39) Dr. Kodama: Nick White.
(12/29 14:05:45) Matthew Allen: OK, thank you for coming Doctor
(12/29 14:05:46) BrettM: Thank you for stopping to speak to us today.
(12/29 14:05:47) Dr. Kodama: Look for community center to open later in the day at least.
(12/29 14:05:51) Dr. Kodama: Good day.
