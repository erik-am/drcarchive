(01/11 13:25:40) Nick White: We've got plenty - just no time to translate.

(01/11 13:26:40) From Malakh in D'ni-Ae'gura: Yup
(01/11 13:26:54) Exileaddict: Recoucou
(01/11 13:26:55) Nick White: Ah... not sure. Not my decision.
(01/11 13:27:05) Soline: Ca va Exile
(01/11 13:27:06) Nick White: I wouldn't hold my breath though... things are pretty tight.
(01/11 13:27:07) Deius: Many of us would love to help
(01/11 13:27:09) From Malakh in D'ni-Ae'gura: do you know where he is here?

(01/11 13:29:39) Malakh: Are you allowed to talk about what the DRC has you working on these days
(01/11 13:29:47) Ragdrazi: Which two
(01/11 13:29:51) JKC: I think I'm ghosting
(01/11 13:29:55) Nick White: Pretty much. I'm not doing anything too exciting right now.
(01/11 13:30:00) Nick White: Just trying to get stuff open.
(01/11 13:30:07) Nick White: Palace area I thought was already open.
(01/11 13:30:10) Nick White: Should be soon.
(01/11 13:30:10) JKC: everyone is very still
(01/11 13:30:17) Nick White: I was just checking it out.
(01/11 13:30:22) Leonor waves
(01/11 13:30:26) JKC: take a look around
(01/11 13:30:40) Malakh: It reach about from arround the barriers. But don't tell the others :)
(01/11 13:30:47) JKC: all frozen
(01/11 13:31:03) Nick White: I don't care if you get past the barriers.
(01/11 13:31:36) Malakh: Really, some how that doesn't surprise me
(01/11 13:32:02) Athena the Beautiful: i see alot of people, judt not you guys
(01/11 13:32:07) Nick White: I'm gonna head up the stairs.

(01/11 13:32:53) Nick White: Anything exciting here?
(01/11 13:33:21) Ragdrazi: Nick... You're DRC right?
(01/11 13:33:24) Nick White: Guess not.
(01/11 13:33:27) turt ole: you are Nick White
(01/11 13:33:54) Malakh: Yeah not much interesting ogoing on in the city right now
(01/11 13:35:22) Nick White: This has always been a cool spot.
(01/11 13:35:26) Kyven nods his head
(01/11 13:36:23) Malakh: it open
(01/11 13:36:34) Nick White: About time
(01/11 13:36:41) Malakh: I did not know the foyer was opened
(01/11 13:37:03) Nick White: I think they just opened it.
(01/11 13:37:17) Leonor: Me neither. Cool!
(01/11 13:37:24) Nick White: Now we just need to get this baby open.
(01/11 13:37:40) Malakh: terminals appear to be having issues, hope laxmen is working on that
(01/11 13:37:40) Nick White: Cool area.
(01/11 13:37:42) Ragdrazi: Now, see, I thought you were DRC.
(01/11 13:37:43) Leonor: I would love to see the Concert Hall.
(01/11 13:37:48) Nick White: Laxman is over his head right now.
(01/11 13:38:01) Nick White: And running from Cate.
(01/11 13:38:09) Nick White: Pretty funny...
(01/11 13:38:11) Ragdrazi: Ah.
(01/11 13:38:18) Malakh: yeah I bet
(01/11 13:38:32) Malakh: lots of technical stuff to be worked on
(01/11 13:38:40) Nick White: You don't tell Cate something is going to be done if it's not going to be done.
(01/11 13:38:43) Nick White: He's finding that out.
(01/11 13:38:46) Ragdrazi: So... Hey... Can I harrass you?
(01/11 13:38:58) Nick White: Uh... depends what you mean by that...
(01/11 13:39:06) Malakh: have you heard anyword about the concert hall opening sinse you mentioned it?
(01/11 13:39:21) Ragdrazi: I was wondering what the DRC knows about the cavern ceiling.
(01/11 13:39:29) Nick White: It's a ways off - still in Kodama's hands as far as I know..
(01/11 13:39:33) Nick White: What about it?
(01/11 13:39:50) Malakh: Ah I see.
(01/11 13:40:22) Ragdrazi: Well. There appear... to me at least... to be large chunks of it sitting on the floor of the ferry terminal and I was wondering how much the DRC knows about the ceilings stablity.
(01/11 13:40:50) Nick White: I haven't heard about ceiling being in the ferry terminal - not sure, to be honest.
(01/11 13:41:01) Nick White: I wouldn't think they woul let people down here though it that was an issue.
(01/11 13:41:36) Nick White: Yeah, I just assumed it was normal debris.
(01/11 13:41:41) Nick White: Not sure though.
(01/11 13:41:59) Ragdrazi: Yeah. But the DRC's weard like that. They say, get a hard hat if you need one... only way to get a hard hat is to go though a dangerous area or find someone who's done it for you...
(01/11 13:42:32) Nick White: I don't think they really expect anyone to be wearing hard hats down here.
(01/11 13:42:35) Nick White: Not in open areas.
(01/11 13:42:46) Nick White: Unless it's a fashion statement.
(01/11 13:42:53) Bontoo: Please open up the stairway
(01/11 13:42:54) Leonor laughs
(01/11 13:42:58) Bontoo: Pritty please
(01/11 13:43:00) Nick White: How much did they open?
(01/11 13:43:01) Malakh: Yeah it seems to be structuraly sound here for now.
(01/11 13:43:06) Kyven: Do you know anything about the history of Eder Delin?
(01/11 13:43:32) Nick White: Eder Delin?
(01/11 13:43:36) Nick White: Not much...
(01/11 13:43:43) Nick White: I haven't done much from there.... I don't think.
(01/11 13:44:01) Altydwarber: this is nice
(01/11 13:44:24) Malakh: Careful
(01/11 13:44:46) Leonor: Warning us of what?
(01/11 13:44:57) Ragdrazi: No, DRC doesn't expect me to wear one, but they told me "if I need one"...
(01/11 13:45:10) Malakh: So you said the DRC doesn't have you doing much. Are you working on anything at all currently? Or just enjoying your time in the cavern?
(01/11 13:45:20) Nick White: Working on stuff...
(01/11 13:45:29) turt ole: thats what they say
(01/11 13:45:30) Nick White: Wherever they need me.
(01/11 13:45:37) Nick White: I've been in Delin a little.
(01/11 13:45:46) Nick White: Been in Er'Cana...
(01/11 13:45:47) Altydwarber: nick how can you walk and see in your KI at the same time
(01/11 13:46:02) Ragdrazi: Could you stop quoting Yeesha?
(01/11 13:46:05) Nick White: Uh... I don't think I do.
(01/11 13:46:16) Malakh: (alty that is a bug)
(01/11 13:46:35) Altydwarber: can anyone hear me?
(01/11 13:46:42) Ragdrazi: NO.
(01/11 13:46:43) Nick White: They'll probably have me work with someone to replace the bridge again...
(01/11 13:46:43) Deius: Yes Alty
(01/11 13:46:46) Nick White: Yes, we can hear you.
(01/11 13:46:55) Ragdrazi: And by no. I mean... no...
(01/11 13:46:56) pappou: shorah
(01/11 13:46:59) Altydwarber: ok I thought that I was a ghost
(01/11 13:47:05) Malakh: thay have you doing manual labor?
(01/11 13:47:10) Deius: you look solid to me ;)
(01/11 13:47:12) Nick White: Yeah, pretty much...
(01/11 13:47:19) Ragdrazi: Pretty up here.
(01/11 13:47:23) pappou: I imara
(01/11 13:47:28) Altydwarber blush...thank you
(01/11 13:47:29) Malakh: I thought you were a translater? I would think they would have the ReEng's doing the dirty work
(01/11 13:47:35) Altydwarber starts to laugh
(01/11 13:47:36) Nick White: You'd think...
(01/11 13:47:36) pappou:
(01/11 13:47:45) Malakh: Hmm
(01/11 13:47:53) pappou: the broken bridge is open
(01/11 13:48:07) Malakh: SO your not happy with the way things are going with the DRC?
(01/11 13:48:13) Altydwarber: no it's not you will fall
(01/11 13:48:17) Nick White: No I'm fine with it.

(01/11 13:48:19) pappou: No rope bridge to cross, however.
(01/11 13:48:25) Nick White: No complaints.
(01/11 13:48:35) Nick White: I don't mind doing some manual labor here and there - seeing new places.
(01/11 13:48:40) Nick White: Not looking at words all day.
(01/11 13:48:57) pappou: hi leonor
(01/11 13:48:59) Leonor: I never though I would see a DRC member jumping some barriers and throwing some cones off the bridge. :)
(01/11 13:49:05) Deius: I forgot my rope in my relto...could have started making a new rope bridge
(01/11 13:49:08) Malakh: Yeah I can understand that. Guess I was reading to much into your statements
(01/11 13:49:24) Nick White: We all have complaints...but that's any job.
(01/11 13:49:38) Malakh: Yeah
(01/11 13:49:40) Altydwarber: lol
(01/11 13:49:40) Ragdrazi: Wow. It's so dark in here I almost didn't see this edge...
(01/11 13:49:46) Nick White: Don't tell anyone Leonor. : )
(01/11 13:49:53) Ragdrazi: One barrior. Way to go DRC.
(01/11 13:49:57) Leonor: Hehe. I won't.
(01/11 13:50:13) Altydwarber: you came to close to the edge I think
(01/11 13:50:19) Ragdrazi: ... well they're three over there...
(01/11 13:50:29) Ragdrazi: Are we not... supposed to be here?
(01/11 13:50:44) Bontoo: Hi hufsa
(01/11 13:51:01) Halvor2: shorah Nick
(01/11 13:51:07) Nick White: Hey.
(01/11 13:51:13) Halvor2: changed your hair?
(01/11 13:51:21) Nick White: Cut it.
(01/11 13:51:32) Altydwarber: lol
(01/11 13:51:43) Nick White: See ya JKC
[Note: Malakh sends Nick a private message, asking how Douglas Sharper is doing]
(01/11 13:51:53) Nick White: He's good Malakh - no need to keep private.
(01/11 13:51:55) Guru: Does Cate not wear one?
(01/11 13:51:57) Nick White: Didn't say much.
(01/11 13:52:06) Malakh: Ok
(01/11 13:52:08) Nick White: I didn't even know he had my phone still.
(01/11 13:52:20) Nick White: He had just gone to the Pats game and was seeing how things were down here.
(01/11 13:52:27) Malakh: Did Sharper say if he was going to come to the cavern?
(01/11 13:52:30) Nick White: Had heard stuff was happening.
(01/11 13:52:34) Nick White: Nah...
(01/11 13:52:36) Guru: I see. So have you tried to add her? We can add by name if they are present.
(01/11 13:52:42) Altydwarber: brrr... scary very deep
(01/11 13:53:02) Nick White: Was just seeing how I was doing and I gave him a quick update of events down here.
(01/11 13:53:05) Guru: Usually we all have some form of communication when we take the journey.
(01/11 13:53:07) Nick White: It was a quick call.
(01/11 13:53:08) Malakh: Well glad to hear is doing well.
(01/11 13:53:08) Bontoo: Hmm
(01/11 13:53:20) Guru: Do you know what it is Donna?
(01/11 13:53:31) Nick White: Yeah he sounded good - although the Pats just won too. : )
(01/11 13:53:38) Nick White: What was that?
(01/11 13:53:38) Guru: Yes, please. :)
(01/11 13:53:54) Ragdrazi: He's working. We're here to bother him while he's working.
(01/11 13:53:54) Malakh: Yeah that would make him happy :)
(01/11 13:53:59) Nick White: Do the cones serve a purpose?
(01/11 13:54:07) Guru: Ok, aprreciate it.
(01/11 13:54:08) Ragdrazi shakes his head
(01/11 13:54:13) Malakh starts to laugh
(01/11 13:54:31) Guru: If you have any other of the DRC's Ki's it would be great to know also
(01/11 13:54:34) Nick White: I think the cones are to warn you that this area is not officially opened.
(01/11 13:54:35) Altydwarber: what are we all wating for ....for someone to get a rope?
(01/11 13:54:41) Ragdrazi: ...
(01/11 13:54:45) Ragdrazi: Like... this area?
(01/11 13:54:49) Nick White: Right.
(01/11 13:54:52) Deius: and a grappling hook
(01/11 13:54:53) Ragdrazi: ...
(01/11 13:54:59) Malakh: ZipLine!
(01/11 13:55:01) Ttreb: C'at seems to have his tongue.
(01/11 13:55:05) JKC: yeah, that was a bad idea to go over that barrior over there
(01/11 13:55:08) Altydwarber: and maybe tarzan
(01/11 13:55:10) JKC: I got stuck :/
(01/11 13:55:12) Nick White: I say we go for a cliff jump.
(01/11 13:55:14) Deius: and Jane
(01/11 13:55:17) Nick White: I gotta get going anyway.
(01/11 13:55:22) Malakh: haha
(01/11 13:55:23) Deius: and a few monkeys
(01/11 13:55:28) Malakh: jeranimo
(01/11 13:55:32) Ragdrazi: ...
(01/11 13:55:35) Altydwarber: or bahro's
(01/11 13:55:43) Nick White: Hmm
(01/11 13:55:56) Nick White: Good talking to you guys - see ya later.
(01/11 13:55:58) Kyven: Shorah, Nick
(01/11 13:56:04) Leonor: Bye, Nick
(01/11 13:56:05) Malakh: Later man
(01/11 13:56:05) Ragdrazi: Good bye.
