(12/20 13:17:21) Victor Laxman: We turned a few things off. Just while we investigate.
(12/20 13:17:25) Rex Havoc: Heek Table is still on order!!
(12/20 13:17:30) Rocky: Lots missing in the hoods..........even no HEEK...arggg.8=((
(12/20 13:17:42) From b'lyn: victor is checking up on us.
(12/20 13:17:55) Marcello: HAve many things changed since a couple off years ago Victor?
(12/20 13:18:01) Matthew Allen: OK so does anyone know how to change the name of the neighborhood I just created? I keep typing in new name and hitting enter and then it changes it back
(12/20 13:18:04) Victor Laxman: Want to be careful. Some very odd occurances.
(12/20 13:18:13) Nyrphame Danilaise: doesn't work yet Matt
(12/20 13:18:22) Rex Havoc: You have to make your new hood provate
(12/20 13:18:23) b'lyn: will we be able to get the first month shirt?
(12/20 13:18:28) From Matthew Allen: Then how does GoG have its name?
(12/20 13:18:29) Victor Laxman: I believe the 'hood names can't be changed yet. We're working on that as well.
(12/20 13:18:46) To Matthew Allen: created an avi named Guild of Greeters matt
(12/20 13:18:51) From Matthew Allen: Ahh
(12/20 13:18:53) Marcello: Does the DRC have a clue yet where these "occurences" are comming from?
(12/20 13:19:04) Nyrphame Danilaise: What odd occurences Victor?
(12/20 13:19:05) Greydragon (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(12/20 13:19:19) b'lyn: is there anything we can do to test specific things?
(12/20 13:19:51) Victor Laxman: There was a point when everyone linked back to Relto.
(12/20 13:20:02) b'lyn nods her head
(12/20 13:20:02) Nyrphame Danilaise: yes it happened to me!
(12/20 13:20:05) Victor Laxman: Accompanied by a loud screem.
(12/20 13:20:11) Marcello: Sounds like the ghost of Yeesha
(12/20 13:20:13) Nyrphame Danilaise: yes horrible! what was it?
(12/20 13:20:21) Rex Havoc: Even if you were ON Relto, you linked to Relto!
(12/20 13:20:24) b'lyn: We were ejected by the Bahro ...
(12/20 13:20:24) Matthew Allen: Does anybody else jump a bit still whenever they hear that Bahro chatter?
(12/20 13:20:33) b'lyn roars with laughter
(12/20 13:20:42) Te'ana shudders
(12/20 13:20:45) Nyrphame Danilaise: yes but that scream was so horrible!
(12/20 13:20:47) Victor Laxman: I was working on the lattice - some very strange spikes. I don't really understand.
(12/20 13:20:48) Marcello: But was this the first time you heard this Victor?
(12/20 13:20:58) Marcello: You have been back for a while here
(12/20 13:21:09) Victor Laxman: Well we've all heard the screems before. But this seemed unique.
(12/20 13:21:13) Nyrphame Danilaise: it was
(12/20 13:21:23) Sparrowhawk: have there been any other mass linkings before?
(12/20 13:21:36) Marcello: Yes I only saw the video footage and it sounded intense
(12/20 13:21:48) Nyrphame Danilaise: it seems they REALLY do not want us here Victor...
(12/20 13:22:06) Victor Laxman: We've been here and there. But things are ramping up in earnest here in D'ni now.
(12/20 13:22:12) Marcello: Or they desperately want to tell us something
(12/20 13:22:14) DAVE: If they really didn't want us here...chances are we couldn't be here now....
(12/20 13:22:27) Te'ana: can we do anything to placate the Bahro?
(12/20 13:22:28) Matthew Allen: If they wanted to kick us out then they failed in that.. there's more people in the cavern now than there were yesterday
(12/20 13:22:39) Victor Laxman: Don't know if they don't want us, or they want us somewhere else, or who "they" actually is?
(12/20 13:22:40) Nyrphame Danilaise: well I don't really understand what kind of energy that took, dave
(12/20 13:23:02) Nyrphame Danilaise: yes Victor I was using "they" but I don't know either
(12/20 13:23:22) Victor Laxman: It's all very mystifying, and that's why we're erroring on the side of caution.
(12/20 13:23:43) b'lyn: any idea how long it will take to be less cautious?
(12/20 13:23:47) Marcello: Isn't there any reference about "them" in D'ni literature?
(12/20 13:23:51) Matthew Allen: Yes, is there a timetable for the investigation?
(12/20 13:24:16) Victor Laxman: I think you all know that the DRC has changed a bit from the old days, but...
(12/20 13:24:23) Marcello: And is the list of ages on the DRC site up to date?
(12/20 13:24:33) Nyrphame Danilaise: all I know is that it creeps me out - which is not something I have ever felt before here
(12/20 13:24:36) Victor Laxman: we're still concerned about safety.
(12/20 13:24:52) DAVE: Ever since I started coming here I've been creeped out...
(12/20 13:25:02) b'lyn: How about if we all promise to wear safety helmets?
(12/20 13:25:04) Victor Laxman: Yes. The cavern feels a bit different today. Can't quite put my finger on it.
(12/20 13:25:09) Te'ana: odd sounds, odd happenings
(12/20 13:25:12) Rex Havoc: I do!
(12/20 13:25:14) Nyrphame Danilaise: yep victor, I agree
(12/20 13:25:31) Rex Havoc thinks DAVE just needs a hug!
(12/20 13:25:41) Nyrphame Danilaise: anything specific you would like us to investigate, to focus on?
(12/20 13:25:58) Nyrphame Danilaise squishes Dave until he is cyanotic
(12/20 13:26:02) Rex Havoc: lol
(12/20 13:26:03) Marcello: Is the entire them doing a round Victor?
(12/20 13:26:08) UruBoo: Shorah
(12/20 13:26:12) Victor Laxman: I think actually today we're just focusing on the wonder of being back. Trying to build a few relationships again...
(12/20 13:26:13) DAVE: Haha
(12/20 13:26:19) b'lyn: shorah UruBook
(12/20 13:26:22) Nyrphame Danilaise: ok
(12/20 13:26:22) Rocky: Lol
(12/20 13:26:31) Marcello: good thing Victor
(12/20 13:26:34) DAVE: God, I'm still jumpy.
(12/20 13:26:35) Victor Laxman: instead of business. :)
(12/20 13:26:38) Rex Havoc: OK, wander and look
(12/20 13:26:39) Nyrphame Danilaise: :)
(12/20 13:26:46) Deledrius: Well, anything we can do to help... just ask. We're eager to assist where it's safe.
(12/20 13:26:47) Victor Laxman: It feels good to be back and busy.
(12/20 13:26:55) Marcello: Amen
(12/20 13:27:01) Matthew Allen: I'm always good at looking busy and important, just ask my boss
(12/20 13:27:03) Te'ana: we hear you :)
(12/20 13:27:04) Nyrphame Danilaise: yes, I am eager to get going again, in a more scientific way
(12/20 13:27:09) Victor Laxman: But we'll have more information this week and next as well, as we move forward.
(12/20 13:27:15) b'lyn: Good to know Victor, time to go through the ages, explore the new limits and reconnect with old friends :)
(12/20 13:27:25) Jeremy: Shorah all.
(12/20 13:27:33) Jeremy: Apparently the city is full.
(12/20 13:27:33) Sparrowhawk: where do we go for information Victor?
(12/20 13:27:35) Nyrphame Danilaise: are we still being cautious about books we find?
(12/20 13:27:37) b'lyn: shorah jeremy
(12/20 13:27:44) Te'ana: a good plan b'lyn
(12/20 13:27:46) Rocky: shorah >>>>>>> Jeremy
(12/20 13:27:51) DAVE: What would happen if we linked into an unstable age?
(12/20 13:27:56) DAVE: Has anyone done that before?
(12/20 13:28:03) Victor Laxman: Nice to have the city full. I might try to get in later today.
(12/20 13:28:08) Jeremy: Does anyone know what the DRC said yesterday? I couldn't get my UU to work.
(12/20 13:28:13) b'lyn: i would guess we try to report our findings to the DRC.
(12/20 13:28:15) Te'ana: shorah newcomers :)
(12/20 13:28:17) Marcello: Well I'm sure you have a back door Victor
(12/20 13:28:28) Rex Havoc: lol, Victor is right here Jeremy
(12/20 13:28:37) Hanon: the auditorium is unstable?
(12/20 13:28:50) Victor Laxman: I belive Kodama was just in the city.
(12/20 13:28:53) Eluran waves
(12/20 13:28:58) Nyrphame Danilaise: DRC said very little, only 3 questions and then the horrible scream
(12/20 13:29:26) Victor Laxman: We're not sure about the Community Room. But I think it's fine. Just trying to be cautious.
(12/20 13:29:27) Jeremy: Horrible scream?
(12/20 13:29:33) Marcello: Anything on the speech the DRC had prepared but couldn't hold yesterday Victor?
(12/20 13:29:33) Rex Havoc: Bahro
(12/20 13:29:42) Jeremy: Ah
(12/20 13:29:48) Nyrphame Danilaise: oh yes Jeremy- horrible horrible cavern-wide scream
(12/20 13:29:50) Jeremy: So what were the 3 questions?
(12/20 13:30:12) Matthew Allen: What is your name, what is your quest, and what is your favorite color
(12/20 13:30:14) Nyrphame Danilaise: they were all the same Jeremyb-bwhat new ages? and the answer was the same too :)
(12/20 13:30:16) Victor Laxman: No DRC speech. Just a general discussion about reopening the cavern.
(12/20 13:30:17) Rex Havoc: LOL
(12/20 13:30:18) Matthew Allen: those were the three questions
(12/20 13:30:22) Resolute Guardian laughs
(12/20 13:30:24) Marcello: ok
(12/20 13:30:26) Rex Havoc: I was GOING to type that but didn't!!
(12/20 13:30:27) Miranna waves
(12/20 13:30:32) Marcello: lol
(12/20 13:30:41) Mireena waves
(12/20 13:30:42) b'lyn: victor thanks for the update, will the DCR send us more messages on our KIs?
(12/20 13:30:58) Jeremy: Did anyone take the colour fuschia?
(12/20 13:31:08) Hanon: I'm starting to think the bahro are all around us but in a different...instance of the location
(12/20 13:31:17) Victor Laxman: The DRC members are traveling about the caven today, checking 'hoods the city for damage.
(12/20 13:31:27) Marcello: I have to go people
(12/20 13:31:28) Victor Laxman: And just saying hello.
(12/20 13:31:33) Matthew Allen: Yes but the person who picked fuschia got force linked out, along with all the other color choices for that matter..
(12/20 13:31:35) Marcello: Have fun and Victor thanx for being here
(12/20 13:31:36) DAVE: Well its reassuring to have you guys here.
(12/20 13:31:59) Deledrius: Will you be reopening areas deemed safe immediately, or will you cautious even with those?
(12/20 13:31:59) Hanon: Because...these other hoods...they're all the same hood, just a different instance like an age book...?
(12/20 13:32:06) Te'ana: its good to know you are looing out for us
(12/20 13:32:07) Victor Laxman: It's reasurring to have you all here! Please help any newcomers find their way.
(12/20 13:32:07) Marcello: Bye everyone
(12/20 13:32:07) Marcello waves
(12/20 13:32:21) Nyrphame Danilaise: thanks victor -we will!
(12/20 13:32:22) Jeremy: Are the bahro's ability to force link everyone simultaniously going to be a consistant issue?
(12/20 13:32:23) Rocky: tKS....8=))
(12/20 13:32:26) b'lyn: of course :) that is half the fun :)
(12/20 13:32:37) Victor Laxman: I think we'll be careful, but not as much as before. Although certain DRC members are more...
(12/20 13:32:50) Alexander Strinadko: Shorah! Glad to see you again. What's new about yesterday's screem?
(12/20 13:32:52) DAVE: Bahro bahro, I just arrived in the cavern when that whole mess happened.
(12/20 13:33:00) Victor Laxman: cautious than others. :)
(12/20 13:33:10) b'lyn: Would it help if we send Xmas cards to the uber cautious ones?
(12/20 13:33:18) Nyrphame Danilaise: anyone who is sitting, could you please stand - it is less "laggy" in here that way :)
(12/20 13:33:19) Maximus: Hey guys
(12/20 13:33:24) Deledrius: Does the DRC have any theories about what happened yesterday?
(12/20 13:33:36) Nyrphame Danilaise: thx
(12/20 13:33:40) b'lyn: Np
(12/20 13:33:45) Victor Laxman: We're just as confused as everyone. Seems very hard to explain.
(12/20 13:33:46) Maximus waves
(12/20 13:33:57) Deledrius: Heh, you can say that again
(12/20 13:34:02) Maximus: whats goin on here?
(12/20 13:34:06) Alexander Strinadko: Victor, will be some KI improvements in near future? Sorry if this question is already asked.
(12/20 13:34:07) Matthew Allen: DRC confused? That implies you folks are fallible ;)
(12/20 13:34:14) Jeremy: Will it be a re-occuring issue?
(12/20 13:34:14) Nyrphame Danilaise: any theories about how a "mass" linking might be accomplished?
(12/20 13:35:26) DAVE: I don't even know how regular linking is accomplished
(12/20 13:35:33) Deledrius: hehe
(12/20 13:35:40) Nyrphame Danilaise: the idea that we all could be whooshed anywhere at any moment is very disturbing!
(12/20 13:35:40) b'lyn: Lol - good point ;)
(12/20 13:35:52) Deledrius: Indeed
(12/20 13:35:53) Victor Laxman: No theories on a mass link. I wouldn't have thought it possible.
(12/20 13:36:03) Rex Havoc: I stay near solid objects so that I can grab hold!
(12/20 13:36:04) Rocky: Or it may be FUN......hehe
(12/20 13:36:11) Miranna: Lol
(12/20 13:36:14) Jeremy: Doesn't it involve ink and books?
(12/20 13:36:19) Alexander Strinadko: DAVE, there is some information in the network. Dr. Watson told us a basic theory.
(12/20 13:36:29) Victor Laxman: But we'll let you know if we figure out anything.
(12/20 13:36:37) Hanon: my theory...that the bahro are invisible because they're in their own alternate dimension but can see us...
(12/20 13:36:38) b'lyn: thanks
(12/20 13:36:39) DAVE: Oh really, didn't know that.
(12/20 13:36:47) Hanon: there could have been hundreds of bahro linking everyone at once?
(12/20 13:36:51) Nyrphame Danilaise: thx - i would at least be interested in any theories
(12/20 13:36:58) Victor Laxman: Well hate rush in and rush out - but I've got a forum post to make.
(12/20 13:37:00) Maximus: So whats happening?
(12/20 13:37:02) Nyrphame Danilaise: like a guardian bahro, hanon?
(12/20 13:37:09) b'lyn: Thanks for the update Victor.
(12/20 13:37:10) Nyrphame Danilaise: that we each have!
(12/20 13:37:10) Deledrius: Thanks for the update!
(12/20 13:37:11) DAVE: Come to think of it, it did seem like something was behind me when it all happened
(12/20 13:37:11) Matthew Allen: We'll be looking out for it Victor
(12/20 13:37:13) Maximus: See ya
(12/20 13:37:14) Matthew Allen: thanks again
(12/20 13:37:16) Rex Havoc: Thank you Victor
(12/20 13:37:17) Jeremy: Or perhaps a polterbahro
(12/20 13:37:20) DAVE: but I wrote it off to errent parnoia
(12/20 13:37:20) Te'ana: thanks Victor
(12/20 13:37:20) Hanon: nice seeing you in the flesh Mr. Laxman
(12/20 13:37:21) Resolute Guardian: Bye Victor
(12/20 13:37:24) Alexander Strinadko: DAVE, it's based on quantum possibilities)
(12/20 13:37:25) Rocky: tKA for the info Victor .........8=)))
(12/20 13:37:25) Nyrphame Danilaise: I like guardian bahro!
(12/20 13:37:27) Slygon: Thanks Victor!
(12/20 13:37:32) Victor Laxman: Thanks for all your support. You'll be seeing a lot more of us. Sorry about that! :)
(12/20 13:37:33) Sparrowhawk: thank you Victor
(12/20 13:37:34) Nyrphame Danilaise: thanks victor that was helful
(12/20 13:37:34) Deledrius: Be safe
(12/20 13:37:36) DAVE: Thank's, Victor
(12/20 13:37:38) Rex Havoc: lol
(12/20 13:37:40) Hanon: you know how this hood...it's the same hood but you can get to different parallel instances of it?
(12/20 13:37:42) Victor Laxman: Cheers, everyone!
(12/20 13:37:42) DAVE: -'
(12/20 13:37:42) Nyrphame Danilaise: and good to see you back
(12/20 13:37:43) Alexander Strinadko: Thanks.
(12/20 13:37:46) Victor Laxman waves

(12/20 13:38:02) Alexander Strinadko waves
(12/20 13:38:07) DAVE: Parallel dimensions are kind of confusing to begin with, you have to admit.
(12/20 13:38:14) Hanon: when you go through the bahro doors...you hear them all around but don't see them and they link you
(12/20 13:38:14) Maximus: So anyone wanna fill me in since I got here in the middle?
(12/20 13:38:15) b'lyn: And off he goes......
(12/20 13:38:22) Hanon: but we work with them all the time!
(12/20 13:38:26) Jeremy: Of course, but such is the nature of the space time continum
(12/20 13:38:28) Nyrphame Danilaise: true dave, but quantum physics does support the notion at least
(12/20 13:38:29) Rex Havoc: Well, Rex is off to work on Ages and look for pot holes!
(12/20 13:38:48) DAVE: Good luck
(12/20 13:38:48) Rocky: Ditto on the pot holes..lol
(12/20 13:38:49) b'lyn: I guess he is stuck
(12/20 13:38:52) Nyrphame Danilaise: K rexy squeesh and see you
(12/20 13:38:53) Rex Havoc (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(12/20 13:38:57) Hanon: we're in the same hood as everyone else...perhaps how the D'ni were able to house thousands of people in a small cavern?
[Note: Victor Laxman has trouble linking through the Nexus Linking Book]
(12/20 13:38:57) b'lyn: This is a problem with this book
(12/20 13:38:58) DAVE: If you need any help I've got a shovel in my truck.
(12/20 13:39:07) Jeremy: And I'm off to shed myself of yet another foreign language hood assignment.
(12/20 13:39:15) Alexander Strinadko: Oh, by the way, if somebody have known me before - I'm Fealinquen. I decided to share my real name.
(12/20 13:39:17) Nyrphame Danilaise: uh oh - Victor needs to get that nexus fixed right away
(12/20 13:39:31) Victor Laxman: Hmmmm, got to put this on my list.
