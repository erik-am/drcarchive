Michael Engberg: Well, the DRC is a bit split on that issue - opening things up. And I have to admit that I'm one of the more cautious ones. My daughter spends time down here and so... well you understand
ian1: We don't know that it was the scream that caused it. It could have been something else.
Do'Tsahvahn: I hope this incident hasn't cost you too much family time. Especially this time of year.
Michael Engberg: I was on the surface with my daughter until today.
Dan'nee: How is she?
Michael Engberg: She's fine. She'll be joining me on Saturday I belive.
Dan'nee: Great!
Michael Engberg: If everything works out.
ian1: How often does she come down here to the cavern?
Michael Engberg: She comes down on occasion. She's been in school. But coming back down now for a while. She loves it down here. Hard to keep her away.
ian1: I can see why
Michael Engberg: I know shes met some of you - but I don't know who.
Dan'nee: What is your particular job with the DRC, Michael Engberg?
Michael Engberg: I'm a structural engineer by trade. Comes in handy. So me being late didn't help with getting things inspected and open. Sorry.
Dan'nee: What were you doing, if you don't mind us asking?
Michael Engberg: Just now?
Dan'nee: that held you up 'till today
Michael Engberg: Oh, on the surface I was spending time with Wheely while she was wrapping up school.
Do'Tsahvahn: Shopping for last minute gifts?
Michael Engberg: No time for shopping.
Dan'nee: Some much needed vacation, I suppose
Michael Engberg: Well, I like it down here as much as any vacation. But every now and then...
Dan'nee: What school is Wheely attending? I'm sorry if I'm getting too personal, but we're all interested in the DRC and the restoration
Michael Engberg: High School in Portland.
Branan: Oregon? or Maine?
Michael Engberg: Oregon, that's we're from. She's been suffering through school, wanting to get back down here.
Dan'nee: Believe me, we understand.
Branan: I know that feeling all too well
Analord: Funny you choose that word. You make it seem you agree she would be better off down here than in school.
Michael Engberg: Well, I'll be "home schooling" her down here for her next semester.
Branan: You can learn the history of the Multiverse down here. Far more interesting than algebra
Analord: That would be an awesome experience. So much for public school...
Do'Tsahvahn: So that's why the classroom imagers are back on...
Alan: May I ask you something about the members of the DRC?
Michael Engberg: Certainly.
Alan: have some or all of you participated in Yeesha's journy?
Michael Engberg: We've all participated in Yeesha's journey. I think we've all changed a bit. We started with some pretty preconcieved notions about things. I think we're more open now.
Analord: That's nice to hear.
Alan: May i ask why you don't carry your relto?
Michael Engberg: I do. You just can't see it.
Do'Tsahvahn: Sorry to hear that.
Dan'nee: No, he means he carries his Relto. You just can't see it
Do'Tsahvahn: Er...
Michael Engberg: Sorry, you can't see my Relto. But I wouldn't be caught without it.
ian1: Is the govornment aware of the existance of D'ni?
Michael Engberg: I have no idea on the governments awareness of this place. They certainly haven't sent any funding.
Alan: May I inquire about how your perceptions have changed between before and after taling the journy?
Michael Engberg: Perceptions at first were very steeped in what we knew. I think we're more open to... what we don't know and understand now.
Alan: Thanks you.
Ragdrazi: magic?
Michael Engberg: Well, some might call it magic. I prefer to think we just don't understand it.
Dan'nee: Have you heard any more from Yeesha lately, that we haven't?
Michael Engberg: We've heard what you've heard regarding Yeesha.
Branan: Are the areas closed off just closed for inspection, to make sure nothing's collapsed over the past couple years, or are there other reason related to the recent linking Event?
Michael Engberg: Most of the closed areas are that way for inspection. We had some minor damage, or at least... we want to make sure it was only minor.
Ragdrazi: Shouldn't we ~all~ have hard hats.
Michael Engberg: I'm glad to see some of you wearing the Santa hats I brought down today.
Do'Tsahvahn: Was there some sort of seismic event when we all linked?
Michael Engberg: I think there were all kinds of events when the link happened.
Alan: thanks fer the hats Michael.
Michael Engberg: Actually I had selfish reasons for the Holiday decor - Wheely. She'll love it.
Do'Tsahvahn: Is the damage at least consistent with a seismic event?
Michael Engberg: Some of the damage is consistant with a seismic event, and some of the changes aren't explainable... by anything I know of.
Do'Tsahvahn: Interesting.
Michael Engberg: But that's what we're looking into. Victor said he saw some kind of spike on the lattice as well. I don't even really know what that means... except it messed up some KI stuff, and imager stuff I believe.
ian1: Can you give an example of one of the unexplainable changes?
Michael Engberg: Well some things just changed. Things that were in certain places were gone, and/or moved. I'm sure you noticed the neighborhood had some items missing. We're looking for those items.
Branan: I know all of you at the DRC are busy, but do you think you could talk to Mr. Laxman about giving a presentation on how the Lattice system actually works? I'm sure that many of us are curious about what exactly it is we wear on our hands
Michael Engberg: I'll talk to Victor about that. I might learn something, too.
Branan: thanks
Michael Engberg: Great Zero is being inspected as well. I'll be heading up there in the next few days. I have no idea what to expect.
Alan: Didn't one of the DRC members earlier say that those items had been removed for some reaosn? is that not true? did they just disapear?
ian1: Were all of the missing items a result of the incident or did you remove some?
Michael Engberg: We turned things off, but didn't really move things.
Michael Engberg: And things haven't really dissapeared, they've just been rearranged. Or they show up again. Very strange. Although we've seen this before. On a smaller scale.
Analord: I have to go.. It was very nice to meet and speak wit you Mr. Engberg...
[eChip jumps down from the Tokotah roof onto the ground below]
Michael Engberg: eChip your safty is in your own hands back here.
Alan: Hulllo echip... how did you get over there? and how can i get over there?
Michael Engberg: I don't recommend it.
eChip: Scared me and I ain't scared of nuttin........
Michael Engberg: We'll do what we can to get this area cleared.
Kero: very soon I hope
Michael Engberg: I hope so. Thanks for your patience.
Dan'nee: We appreciate your efforts, Micahel. And all the DRC
Michael Engberg: It's a marvelous place, the city proper. But in much worse condition than here. There are many more areas here to open before the city proper.
Alan: you do realize that being patronised aout our safety is not endearing.>? I mean its my responsibility to look after my self. why am i not allowed to decide whats safe for me?
Kero: I just want more places to explore
Michael Engberg: We'll finish up our inspections, and try to get on to some other places and ages. We know you want them soon.
Do'Tsahvahn: What is beyond the gate tunnel by the Ferry Terminal?
Michael Engberg: It goes over below the concert halll. D'ni used to sail their boats over there and listen to the concerts in that canyon. Must have been magnificent.
eChip: goto Eder Gira (steam vents), jump over the stream, touch linking book then
catherwood: i'm still in awe of what i see right now, sure would love a boat ride out on the water to take it all in
Kero: And I wish the DRC would stop treating me like a child
eChip: Link to the Tokotah roof top then get on the pile of boxes then
Michael Engberg: How old are you Kero?
Kero: pushing 40
Michael Engberg: Sometimes the children have more benefits than the adults around here.
Ragdrazi: ...
Alan: how do you mean Michael?
Michael Engberg: Well I'll leave you all to try killing yourself by jumping off the Tokotah rooftop! Thanks for chatting. It's nice to see so many of you.
Dan'nee: Thanks for answering out questions, Michael
K'Dahta: nice talking to you
Branan: Thank you for taking the time to speak with us
Michael Engberg: Of course. Thanks again for your patience. I'm sure you'll be seeing more of me.
Dan'nee: Shorah
