(12/26 13:37:44) To Marie Sutherland: when would you guys be up for another TH? I was thinking perhaps its time for another DRC introduction TH for the new explorers
(12/26 13:43:49) From Marie Sutherland in The Liaisons's Bevin: Sorry, I was trying to get the Liaison's Hood set up. I've sent all the liaisons invites now.
(12/26 13:50:15) Tweek: nifty will have to mention this to the others
(12/26 13:50:25) Marie Sutherland: Good afternoon, Tweek. It's nice to see you again.
(12/26 13:50:31) Tweek: likewise
(12/26 13:50:42) Tweek: nice to see the cavern busy again
(12/26 13:51:00) Marie Sutherland: Yes. It's very nice.
(12/26 13:51:30) Tweek: glad I bumped into you actually
(12/26 13:52:54) Tweek: We've been getting alot of questions regarding whats happened in the Cavern in the past (ie Phil, Sharper etc) and so we started writing up a brief synopsis of past events and sources for further reading to bring people up to date. But we were wondering if it would be possible to steal one of the DRC books to put this all in and leave in the classroom for new explorers?
(12/26 13:53:36) Marie Sutherland: I'll see if I can find one.
(12/26 13:53:42) Tweek: thanks
(12/26 13:54:13) Tweek: we were also wondering if the ResEngs could just mention us in their orientation just so people know we exist and what not.
(12/26 13:55:02) Tweek folds up his list of demans and pops it back in his pocket
(12/26 13:55:04) Marie Sutherland: noted
(12/26 13:55:30) Tweek: thanks again
(12/26 13:55:43) Marie Sutherland: You're welcome.
(12/26 13:55:51) Tweek: you guys have a good christmas?
(12/26 13:56:04) Marie Sutherland: Yes. Thanks. Did you?
(12/26 13:56:18) Tweek: Yep, was nice and peaceful
(12/26 13:59:10) Tweek: Well its back to work for me, thanks for setting up the hood for us. I know I plan to get an alternate KI for DRCL use and I think the others will too so we might need to bug you for hood invites or memberships again
(12/26 13:59:20) Marie Sutherland: Glad to hear it. Sorry, I'm being PM'd about the scopes...
(12/26 13:59:32) Tweek: no rest for the wicked
(12/26 13:59:57) Marie Sutherland: OK, Tweek, just let me know and I'll re-invite. Thanks
(12/26 14:00:24) Tweek: will do, oh just out of curiosity when will the auditorium be open next? just for TH references
(12/26 14:00:24) Marie Sutherland (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(12/26 14:01:39) Marie Sutherland: I'm not sure. Sorry.
(12/26 14:01:57) Tweek: ok no worries we can work something out if needs be
(12/26 14:02:14) Tweek: anyway thanks again
