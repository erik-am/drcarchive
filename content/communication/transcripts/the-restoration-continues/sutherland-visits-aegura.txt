(12/25 04:38:07) Marie Sutherland: Working late, actually.
(12/25 04:38:07) Roger Telco: hello dr sutherland
(12/25 04:38:19) BrettM: Maybe on the Gallery doors?
(12/25 04:38:51) Abjab: Do I get in ther fron the roof Jump ?
(12/25 04:39:07) BrettM: I don't think that's DRC approved. B-)
(12/25 04:39:08) Marie Sutherland: I believe Michael Enberg is working on the Gallery Doors.
(12/25 04:39:25) BrettM: Ah. I noticed you visited Kadish Tolesa.
(12/25 04:39:26) Marie Sutherland: Definitely not DRC approved. :D
(12/25 04:39:45) Roger Telco: that will be great when it happens. always wanted to see that open from city.
(12/25 04:40:06) BrettM: Yes, an exciting prospect.
(12/25 04:40:51) Roger Telco: there is a mike and podium over near tent ... will the DRC be able to use that for meetings some day?
(12/25 04:40:52) Marie Sutherland: Well, I just wanted to say hi and wish everyone a Merry Christmas.
(12/25 04:40:58) Hitana: have a nice chritmas day
(12/25 04:41:04) Roger Telco: you too Doctor S.
(12/25 04:41:04) BrettM: Thank you.
(12/25 04:41:10) Hitana: christmas
(12/25 04:41:26) Link9: Merry Christmas to all
(12/25 04:41:36) BrettM: Don't work too late. Relax a bit.
(12/25 04:41:50) Marie Sutherland: Roger, yes, that was the plan several years ago. I'm not sure if they still work. Maybe we'll get a chance to try them in the near future.
(12/25 04:41:52) Hitana: hello marie!
(12/25 04:42:10) Marie Sutherland: Hello, Hitana
(12/25 04:42:54) Hitana: something new for us explorers :)
(12/25 04:43:20) Marie Sutherland: Um....
(12/25 04:43:27) Marie Sutherland: Hmm...
(12/25 04:43:56) Marie Sutherland: I'm too tired to be clever. :D
(12/25 04:44:14) BrettM: We appreciate having the imagers back, anyway.
(12/25 04:44:27) Roger Telco: we don't mean to ambush you ... thanks for your hard work
(12/25 04:44:37) Marie Sutherland: I'm glad that Victor got them ready
(12/25 04:45:00) BrettM: Now, if Mr. Engberg can only fix the fountains ... B-)
(12/25 04:45:00) Marie Sutherland: You're very welcome. Thank you all for your patience.
(12/25 04:45:06) Hitana: yes everything new is nice, just if its a little thing
(12/25 04:45:46) Roger Telco: btw it is good to see the reseng tours so well attended
(12/25 04:45:52) Hitana: thanks for beeing here so late marie
(12/25 04:46:01) BrettM: Yes, that is a great outreach program!
(12/25 04:46:16) Hitana: wish i could join it Sad
(12/25 04:46:24) Marie Sutherland: I've heard good things about the tours, and heard a few comments from hecklers.
(12/25 04:46:37) BrettM: Even many of the experienced explorers have been attending.
(12/25 04:46:37) Roger Telco: ?
(12/25 04:47:02) Hitana: too late on this side of the world then
(12/25 04:47:27) Marie Sutherland: Nothing tragic, but we'll probably have to set some guidelines at some point...
(12/25 04:47:43) Marie Sutherland: So that the tours are available to those who need them most.
(12/25 04:48:28) Marie Sutherland: I only heard something from someone who heard something from someone who heard something from one of the resEngs
(12/25 04:48:41) Roger Telco: Dr S., I am a bit worried about scalability of Ae'gura -- several times we have filled up to 40 people and others cannot get in.
(12/25 04:48:44) BrettM: I think the Liaisons could help spread that word.
(12/25 04:48:49) Marie Sutherland: So we need to look into it more and find out what actually happened.
(12/25 04:49:11) Marie Sutherland: All in good time, Roger.
(12/25 04:49:20) Roger Telco: Just mentioning it for DRC to think about, I fear the very popularity of Aegura will be an issue.
(12/25 04:49:38) Hitana: thats right, the legs are not that good
(12/25 04:49:49) Hitana: lags
(12/25 04:49:52) BrettM: More traffic seems to be going to the hoods these days, as they get established.
(12/25 04:50:15) Marie Sutherland: As it should be, BrettM :D
(12/25 04:50:18) Roger Telco: Yes, both the GoG and Beginner hoods have been busy the last couple of days.
(12/25 04:51:44) BrettM: Once there are more attractions in the hoods, like heek, that should help.
(12/25 04:52:18) Hitana: may you say something about this downloading thing marie?
(12/25 04:52:38) Kai-Uwe: Dr. Sutherland, are you on duty here during the Xmas-days ore can you spend some time with your familiy?
(12/25 04:52:42) Roger Telco: I have this vision of the classroom imagers becoming the future "big screen tv" for all DRC events to be televised
(12/25 04:52:49) BrettM: Yes, can Mr. Laxman get that cleared out of the lattice?
(12/25 04:52:51) Marie Sutherland: Yes, and once more areas of the city are open again, I'm sure Victor will be tweaking the...
(12/25 04:52:58) Roger Telco: would allow people to participate from the hoods.
(12/25 04:53:02) Roger Telco: (someday)
(12/25 04:53:03) Marie Sutherland: settings in the nexus.
(12/25 04:53:15) Hitana: that sounds nice
(12/25 04:53:38) Marie Sutherland: Victor is aware of the "Downloading" issue, but has more important things on his plate.
(12/25 04:53:54) Hitana: lol i can guess so
(12/25 04:53:54) Arreaon: So i've never been so the Ferry Terminal before
(12/25 04:54:07) BrettM: I'm sure he still has many aftereffects to deal with from the 19th.
(12/25 04:54:12) Hitana: what about the new ages?
(12/25 04:54:24) Marie Sutherland: Welcome to Ae'gura then, Arreaon.
(12/25 04:54:27) Hitana: yeah that scream...
(12/25 04:55:10) Marie Sutherland: BrettM, Indeed he does, as do we all.
(12/25 04:55:44) Hoe KanDat: Sorry if this has been asked (just fell in) but any new onwhen more of the city wille beopened

(12/25 04:56:49) Marie Sutherland: Hoe KanDat, no new news. We hope to have more areas open in the not too distant future.
(12/25 04:57:11) Hitana: wish the algaes would shine as they did before the fall...
(12/25 04:57:14) Arreaon: "not too distant" meaning what? a week...a month...a year
(12/25 04:57:22) Marie Sutherland: Hello, Curty.
(12/25 04:57:25) Hoe KanDat: Thanks, btw like your idea of opening the Kadish Gallery doors ...
(12/25 04:57:49) Hitana: yeah thats a good one!
(12/25 04:57:51) Marie Sutherland: Arreaon, I don't have a specific time frame to give. Whenever it's ready.
(12/25 04:57:58) Hoe KanDat: Would like to help investigate this instance thing Mr. Laxman talked about in that way
(12/25 04:58:30) Aleks: Any new word on the "instancing," by the way? Are we any closer to understanding what's going on?
(12/25 04:58:31) BrettM: Have you seen the flowchart VidKid did on the instancing situation?
(12/25 04:59:13) Marie Sutherland: Hoe KanDat, we are hoping to have the Gallery doors open later this week.
(12/25 04:59:25) Kai-Uwe: Great!
(12/25 04:59:35) Curty: yes how awesome!!!
(12/25 04:59:35) Hoe KanDat: Ok, now that is news ... :)

(12/25 05:00:18) Aleks: Welcome Arreaon.
(12/25 05:00:25) Arreaon: I also have 10,000 years of D'ni history to catch up...or at least Brett tells me so
(12/25 05:00:29) Marie Sutherland: it's great to have new people down here again. :D
(12/25 05:01:19) Hitana: yes new ones are always welcome....get the cavern full!
(12/25 05:01:43) Arreaon: Well when this city is opening more areas to the public...add some lights
(12/25 05:01:46) Curty: Marie, are you a friend of Victor Laxman?
(12/25 05:02:07) Curty: Sorry, I'm new as well
(12/25 05:02:28) Marie Sutherland: Victor and I work together. We've known each other many years now. :)
(12/25 05:02:30) Hitana: you dont have to be sorry for that
(12/25 05:02:47) Curty: Oh I see
(12/25 05:04:10) Hoe KanDat: Miss( Mrs?) Sutherland, do you know a person named Bishop by the way?
(12/25 05:04:10) Marie Sutherland: Bye, Arreaon. Nice to meet you.
(12/25 05:04:24) Arreaon: Nice to meet you too
(12/25 05:04:47) Marie Sutherland: Hoe KanDat, I don't recognize the name, sorry.
(12/25 05:04:49) Arreaon: I look forward to a beautiful city Dr. Sutherland
(12/25 05:05:04) BrettM: Yes, a very strange person calling himself "Bishop" has been seeking Dr. Kodama.
(12/25 05:05:28) Hoe KanDat: He was in a few days ago asking for 'dr KOdama, according to some messages on the boards
(12/25 05:05:35) Marie Sutherland: I will let Dr. Kodama know, the next time I see him.
(12/25 05:05:56) Hitana: say engberg thx for the santas hats

(12/25 05:06:20) Marie Sutherland yawns
(12/25 05:06:34) Hoe KanDat: Just hope we don't have to return them after the holidays .. like to keep it in my closet
