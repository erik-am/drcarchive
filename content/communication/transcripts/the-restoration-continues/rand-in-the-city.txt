(12/21 18:44:40) ireenquench waves
(12/21 18:44:47) Matthew Allen: What evil things are you downloading to our KIs, Rand? ;)
(12/21 18:44:51) Rand: I'm just Rand ;)
(12/21 18:44:58) Thend: Don't crowd Rand, the Man, Val
(12/21 18:45:17) 4runner: Give him some space
(12/21 18:45:20) Rand: How's everything going
(12/21 18:45:22) Rand: ?
(12/21 18:45:35) Kam Uraki: You tell us :P
(12/21 18:45:36) 4runner: Fine, a few hiccups but not bad
(12/21 18:45:37) ireenquench: How are you?
(12/21 18:45:43) gelf56: fine thx we are all just noticing something happeneing in our ki's
(12/21 18:45:44) Temin: Terrific, but a number of us are minorly confused :-)
(12/21 18:45:46) Valdez: Are you the the Rand Miller?
(12/21 18:45:53) Rand: Yeah, a few hiccups. :)
(12/21 18:45:57) Matthew Allen: Finished the Journey again yesterday, looking forward to the beginning of What's Next
(12/21 18:45:58) 4runner: A few CTD's
(12/21 18:46:04) Kam Uraki: Yeah, it's him Vald.
(12/21 18:46:07) Thend: Fine and dandy, Rand. There's been some unrest about the DRC, Yeesha, and the Bahro, but that was only from some rabble-rouser
(12/21 18:46:28) Kam Uraki: I thought YOU were the rabble rouser
(12/21 18:46:32) Kam Uraki: Thend
(12/21 18:46:34) Thend: Oh yeah
(12/21 18:46:36) ireenquench laughs
(12/21 18:46:48) Matthew Allen: I still think the DRC wanted those viewers for that sports bar they're working on
(12/21 18:46:49) Junee: The Psion says hi ;)
(12/21 18:47:11) 4runner: Is the city going to start opening soon
(12/21 18:47:35) Kam Uraki: I've let Thend take over my old job of raising trouble. I just make vids that make fun of authority now.
(12/21 18:47:44) ian1: Rand is here...
(12/21 18:47:46) Matthew Allen: Hmm, KI still says downloading.. I guess D'ni never got broadband
(12/21 18:47:47) Thend nods his head
(12/21 18:47:48) Kam Uraki: Yep
(12/21 18:47:49) ian1: :D
(12/21 18:48:16) Rand: So I'm just making the rounds. And the action is here! :)
(12/21 18:48:29) Thend cheers
(12/21 18:48:31) Kam Uraki: Speaking of which, if you wanna see the best Uru machinima ever, Rand. go to www.bakasavants.com ;)
(12/21 18:48:34) Matthew Allen: Action is this hood's middle name
(12/21 18:48:37) 4runner: nice of you to join us
(12/21 18:48:45) Temin: Uru "Action" Obsession?
(12/21 18:48:47) Junee: hi Tweek
(12/21 18:48:54) Rand: My pleasure. Thanks for all of your support!
(12/21 18:48:57) Thend: It's a plug, but a good one *sigh*
(12/21 18:49:13) ireenquench: Ya, mysteriuos KI message, I suspect it means linking to surface and back, to get an update on the lattice or something.
(12/21 18:49:16) Tweek: 'lo kids
(12/21 18:49:22) 4runner: We are happy to help out
(12/21 18:49:23) Matthew Allen: Thanks for the game that we have TO support!
(12/21 18:49:30) Thend: Hello Tweek
(12/21 18:49:35) Kam Uraki: Okay Ian, fair enough, it's the ONLY Uru machinima
(12/21 18:49:53) Tweek: hmm one day this DRC KI message with finally download..I think they need to contact their KISP
(12/21 18:49:53) Rand: I'll check out the Machinima
(12/21 18:49:59) Kam Uraki: :D
(12/21 18:50:14) Rand: What is the DRC KI message?
(12/21 18:50:20) Rand: It's downloading?
(12/21 18:50:24) Thend nods his head
(12/21 18:50:29) Temin: Yeah, we can't open it
(12/21 18:50:29) Matthew Allen: Its just said downloading for quite some time now
(12/21 18:50:29) Kam Uraki: I'll give you full access to the site ASAP then Rand :)
(12/21 18:50:30) Tweek: I don't know its been downloading for about 10 minutes or so now
(12/21 18:50:32) ireenquench: says ---Downloading--- in yellow
(12/21 18:50:52) Kam Uraki: Apparently the DRC needs KI's that have broadband
(12/21 18:51:03) ian1: Wouldn't you of all people know about it?
(12/21 18:51:09) Tweek: I poked Kodama about it but I think he's asleep under his Relto Imager again
(12/21 18:51:12) Junee: Maybe it's a DRC joke. They're all sitting somewhere and laughing at us now
(12/21 18:51:13) Rukitan: ?
(12/21 18:51:13) Matthew Allen: DRC doesn't tell him everything ;)
(12/21 18:51:17) Thend: I don't trust them DRC, Rand...
(12/21 18:51:21) Rand: Ah - I see. Let me check on that. ;)
(12/21 18:51:24) Rukitan: What?
(12/21 18:51:26) Tweek: its bahro spyware
(12/21 18:51:30) Thend starts to laugh
(12/21 18:51:35) Kam Uraki: lol, Tweek
(12/21 18:51:42) Matthew Allen: Yeah, if my KI starts giving me pop-up adds for bahro stones I'm gonna be upset
(12/21 18:51:45) ireenquench: Cool, Rand has direct communication with the DRC ;)
(12/21 18:51:51) Temin: Man they can send whole people through the spaces between worlds, but they can't send a couple of kilobytes to a D'ni Blackberry
(12/21 18:52:05) Rand: I have a few connections. ;)
(12/21 18:52:05) Thend: lol
(12/21 18:52:52) Rand: I think that's just a bug in the lattice.
(12/21 18:53:00) TomahnaGuy: shorah
(12/21 18:53:01) Rand: (According to Victor)
(12/21 18:53:03) TomahnaGuy: Wow
(12/21 18:53:03) Rukitan: Um......hello
(12/21 18:53:04) 4runner: So how is everthing progressing
(12/21 18:53:06) TomahnaGuy: Rand!
(12/21 18:53:16) TomahnaGuy: Whats the latest?
(12/21 18:53:25) TomahnaGuy: Im getting a downloading ki message
(12/21 18:53:28) Matthew Allen: A bug in the lattice? I thought Victor put up those zappers to keep them out
(12/21 18:53:30) Kam Uraki: So Rand... I gotta say this, though I'm sure you hear it all the time. Thank you for Myst. It really helped me realize I wanted to do something creative for a living
(12/21 18:53:30) Rand: Something to do with a classroom imager message
(12/21 18:53:39) Tweek: this is why you don't use the lattice to play Line Rider
(12/21 18:53:49) TomahnaGuy: Whats going on!?
(12/21 18:53:50) ireenquench: Oh... so the lattice is still affected huh? Have you heard about what happened on the 19th, the mass link? what do you think caused it?
(12/21 18:54:44) Thend: I think it was a Lattice pulse
(12/21 18:55:31) TomahnaGuy: It was weird
(12/21 18:55:39) TomahnaGuy: We were all linked to our respective reltos
(12/21 18:55:39) Matthew Allen: It's going to be funny if the imager in the classroom starts up with "Catherine my love..."
(12/21 18:55:44) Thend starts to laugh
(12/21 18:55:44) TomahnaGuy: Lol
(12/21 18:55:50) Valdez laughs
(12/21 18:55:58) Kam Uraki slaps his forehead
(12/21 18:56:29) ireenquench: And it was very loud, the scream and they are very active.
(12/21 18:56:34) Junee: "I realized the moment I fell into the fissure..."
(12/21 18:56:35) TomahnaGuy: I wonder if the lattice is ok?
(12/21 18:56:37) Rukitan: Howlin at that dreamy ol hunka moooOOOooon
(12/21 18:56:42) Rand: Yeah.
(12/21 18:56:49) TomahnaGuy: Have the DRC said anything Rand?
(12/21 18:57:01) From ireenquench: Kodama is in Aegura
(12/21 18:57:03) Tweek: I always figured the moon to be more studly than hunka
(12/21 18:57:13) Thend: Are you checking with the DRC on this Rand? Kodama's in the City...
(12/21 18:57:23) Rand: They've been all over lately - the DRC.
(12/21 18:57:23) TomahnaGuy: Is he?
(12/21 18:57:24) Kam Uraki: I still say we should borrow the Zandimobile and go buy a bunch of boa constrictors, just to keep the bahro at bay
(12/21 18:57:29) TomahnaGuy: Bahro
(12/21 18:57:31) Rand: I think they enjoy seeing everyone again.
(12/21 18:57:43) TomahnaGuy: Its nice
(12/21 18:57:43) Rukitan: HO HO HO MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!
(12/21 18:57:48) Thend cheers
(12/21 18:57:51) TomahnaGuy: so what have they said?
(12/21 18:57:53) K'laamas: Hey all :)
(12/21 18:57:54) ian1 cheers
(12/21 18:57:58) Thend waves
(12/21 18:58:04) Tweek: hmm I need to go bug Kodama about Great Tree jackets before I get mobbed by the GT folkses
(12/21 18:58:06) Rukitan: HUH?
(12/21 18:58:15) Thend: It's like Tiny Tim
(12/21 18:58:19) Rand: Thanks!
(12/21 18:58:20) Justin: Is Rand here?
(12/21 18:58:20) Thend wipes away a tear
(12/21 18:58:24) ian1: Yes.
(12/21 18:58:24) ireenquench: I enjoy it too, and merry Xmas, yeah.
(12/21 18:58:26) Justin: Ah
(12/21 18:58:26) TomahnaGuy: Greydragons online
(12/21 18:58:26) Rukitan: Tiny tim my but
(12/21 18:58:27) Kam Uraki: TG... It's Rand! The king of cryptic. He's not gonna directly tell us :P
(12/21 18:58:29) Rand: Was that Valdez talking?
(12/21 18:58:40) Thend nods his head
(12/21 18:58:49) Rand: If only I knew anything! :)
(12/21 18:58:56) TomahnaGuy: Hehe
(12/21 18:59:00) Rand: The DRC is so secretive.
(12/21 18:59:05) TomahnaGuy: I know
(12/21 18:59:07) K'laamas: Ah, I wondered what the crowd was about :)
(12/21 18:59:08) ireenquench: I gotta go to the surface, cya all
(12/21 18:59:10) Justin: Does he hav an explanation for that "Downloading" thing?
(12/21 18:59:11) Temin: They're even keeping Rand out of the loop
(12/21 18:59:12) BrettM: Why was the scope considered too dangerous for us to have any more?
(12/21 18:59:13) Rukitan: *yawn*
(12/21 18:59:16) Temin: Perhaps it's a consipiracy...
(12/21 18:59:21) Junee: cya ireen
(12/21 18:59:22) Kam Uraki: Could be worse... could be the Bush administration
(12/21 18:59:28) Rukitan: how do you do those expresions?
(12/21 18:59:30) Rand: Those scopes are lethal weapons you know.
(12/21 18:59:32) Matthew Allen: The trouble with the DRC is you can never tell when they're being vague about what they know or being vague about what they DON'T know
(12/21 18:59:36) Kam Uraki acts innocent
(12/21 18:59:36) TomahnaGuy: Should we go to see Kodama in the city Rand?
(12/21 18:59:39) Thend: If I side with an group in this crazy, mixed-up Cavern - it's Cyan
(12/21 18:59:40) Valdez: Oh nO
(12/21 18:59:46) Tweek: we need Top Men (and Women) to work with the DRC then we'd have knoweldge stuffs
(12/21 18:59:50) Justin: He's not in the city
(12/21 18:59:55) TomahnaGuy: kodma is
(12/21 18:59:56) Junee: What expressions Rutikan?
(12/21 18:59:56) Rand: Is he there? If he is you should try. It'll fill up fast.
(12/21 19:00:00) Rukitan: *Starts Poka dancing*
(12/21 19:00:01) ian1: Kadoma is in the city?
(12/21 19:00:05) Tweek: and I can be taught how to type a sentence sans the typos
(12/21 19:00:06) TomahnaGuy: Yes
(12/21 19:00:10) TomahnaGuy: Kodma is in the city
(12/21 19:00:17) Kam Uraki: Kodama is tending a zen garden in his relto for all we know
(12/21 19:00:19) Thend: lol
(12/21 19:00:20) Justin: It's Quiet
(12/21 19:00:29) Thend: It's a little faint Rand
