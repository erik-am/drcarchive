(12/20 14:25:14) Marie Sutherland: Ah, well, welcome to the cavern, BrettM.
(12/20 14:25:38) BrettM: Thanks. I was hoping to find one of the UO owners here so I could get an invite.
(12/20 14:26:09) Marie Sutherland: Hmm... maybe one will be by soon.
(12/20 14:26:11) BrettM: It's good to see that the DRC weren't spirited away yesterday.
(12/20 14:26:43) Marie Sutherland: I've got to continue looking through the neighborhoods.
(12/20 14:27:16) Marie Sutherland: Yes, we're still trying to figureout what exactly happened
(12/20 14:28:05) BrettM: Why have so many "incidental" items disappeared, like the heek tables?
(12/20 14:28:16) BrettM: Surely they don't present some danger?
(12/20 14:28:16) K'Huunah: and the fountain water
(12/20 14:28:36) Marie Sutherland: Hmm... have you heard of people who have been missing since the scream happened?
(12/20 14:28:59) BrettM: No, though a few were preparing search parties to look for the DRC!
(12/20 14:30:24) BrettM: Are there any people missing?
(12/20 14:30:39) Marie Sutherland: Thanks for your concern. All the DRC members are accounted for. We're just busy checking things.
(12/20 14:30:49) K'Huunah: good to hear it
(12/20 14:31:35) K'Huunah: shorah, GD
(12/20 14:31:42) Greydragon: oh hey DRC!
(12/20 14:31:46) BrettM: Hi, Greydragon.
(12/20 14:31:55) Marie Sutherland: Hello, Greydragon.
(12/20 14:31:59) Greydragon: be back later
(12/20 14:32:21) BrettM: Come back when you can stay long enough for a beer! B-)
(12/20 14:32:35) Linkin' Imp: He saw me and ran away
(12/20 14:32:43) Marie Sutherland: Well, I should continue on as well.
