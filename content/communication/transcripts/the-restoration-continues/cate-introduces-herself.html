(01/03 20:29:05) Cate Alexander: I figured it's time to bring my role out in the open and let everyone know who I am and what I'm doing.

(01/03 20:29:36) Cate Alexander: To make a long story short, I was able to play a key role in procurring funding for a continued effort.

(01/03 20:31:18) Cate Alexander: Much of the last few months I've spent examing the current state of affairs and working with other companies, such as Turner, to come up with a plan.
(01/03 20:31:41) Cate Alexander: The plan is not finished but we have come a long way.
(01/03 20:32:06) Cate Alexander: You'll be seeing some of the results of that in the near future. In many ways you already have.
(01/03 20:33:12) Cate Alexander: It's my job to make sure this effort succeeds and that it succeeds in a timely and safe fashion.
