(12/20 13:10:41) Dr. Kodama: We're still not sure what exactly happened
(12/20 13:10:46) From J'ena: i hear it was quite an experience yesterday!
(12/20 13:10:49) Dr. Kodama: Safety precautions.
(12/20 13:10:50) Whilyam: And imagers down?
(12/20 13:10:53) Altydwarber: me neither lol
(12/20 13:11:00) Ashtar: Well it was definitely scary
(12/20 13:11:03) susanszy: at least we have new KIs!
(12/20 13:11:08) J'ena: i couldn't get in, so am hearing about it second hand
(12/20 13:11:10) Whilyam: Safety... something I've wanted to ask you, Dr..
(12/20 13:11:11) Tracker (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(12/20 13:11:30) J'ena: i've got a different KI number than the one the forum asked for
(12/20 13:11:42) Ashtar: So how is Marie?
(12/20 13:11:52) Dr. Kodama: She is good. Should be down soon.
(12/20 13:11:59) J'ena: Can anyone see me?
(12/20 13:12:03) Ashtar: That's great to hear
(12/20 13:12:09) Altydwarber: yes jena
(12/20 13:12:10) susanszy: I see you J'ena
(12/20 13:12:11) Gadren smiles
(12/20 13:12:14) Emgee: I feel like I'm in prologue again
(12/20 13:12:15) J'ena: Thanks
(12/20 13:12:17) Whilyam: The DRC tries to keep people safe, yet the time when you guys were gone there hasn't been a single disappearance. Isn't it possible the DRC's safety precautions are just creating moretension leading to willful revolt?
(12/20 13:12:20) J'ena: No jumps i see
(12/20 13:12:34) Dr. Kodama: Yes.
(12/20 13:12:41) Dr. Kodama: That's entirely possible.
(12/20 13:12:52) Dr. Kodama: But we're in charge now.
(12/20 13:12:54) Gadren: Heh, now if that's not a loaded question, Whilyam, I don't know what is...
(12/20 13:12:57) susanszy: But Whil, how do we *know* there have been no disappearance?
(12/20 13:13:03) darkstar: shout/ /might be a good idea to move away from the link in spot
(12/20 13:13:04) susanszy: s
(12/20 13:13:05) Ashtar: Typical DRC arrogance
(12/20 13:13:11) Dr. Kodama: Excuse me?
(12/20 13:13:26) Anthony: Right Suzanszy
(12/20 13:13:32) Tweek: actually after the DRC pulled out Sharper vanished
(12/20 13:13:32) susanszy pokes Ashtar
(12/20 13:13:38) Emgee: Really no place else to gather is there?
(12/20 13:13:43) Anthony: I've seen weird stuff in the cavern before
(12/20 13:13:46) J'ena: Quite a good conference going on, but i have to leave. seee youall later
(12/20 13:13:47) Gadren: Settle down, Ashtar, let's not get carried away...wehave more important things to talk about right now
(12/20 13:13:47) Ashtar: Actually we are all part of the restoration Dr. Kodama, not just the DRC
(12/20 13:13:50) J'ena waves
(12/20 13:13:51) Dr. Kodama: We're not trying to be arrogant. We are trying to protect people now that we are responsible again.
(12/20 13:13:59) Ti'chelle: Up on the landing of the stair maybe?
(12/20 13:14:00) Dr. Kodama: If someone is hurt, it's our fault.
(12/20 13:14:08) Donna: Talking with Kodamam at the ferry landing
(12/20 13:14:22) Dr. Kodama: Hopefully that makes sense to you.
(12/20 13:14:33) Donna: oops PM failure. Sorry
(12/20 13:14:36) Ashtar: Yes, but I think this needs to be a shared project, not just the DRC
(12/20 13:14:36) Gadren: Anyway, Dr. Kodama, I noticed during that meeting last night that you said "what the..." or something like that a little bit before the big Link...what did you mean by that?
(12/20 13:14:38) Altydwarber: can we help to restore things so that we can explore the hoods more?
(12/20 13:14:41) Whilyam: Yet no one was hurt when you were gone.
(12/20 13:14:50) darkstar: Case of shutting the door after the horse has bolted
(12/20 13:14:53) Ti'chelle: We can understand the caution. Who wants to get hit on the head with a falling rock!
(12/20 13:14:56) Whilyam: This is all I was attempting to point out, Dr.
(12/20 13:15:01) susanszy: again, Whil, we can't be sure....
(12/20 13:15:04) Dr. Kodama: Whilyam, I agree. And that is fortunate.
(12/20 13:15:28) darkstar: And i dont recall asking you to be responsible for me
(12/20 13:15:52) Whilyam: Eh, keep in mind, darkstar, the DRC IS legally liable.
(12/20 13:16:00) Kedry: Say, shouldn't we be signing a waiver or something?
(12/20 13:16:02) Dr. Kodama: We are being funded to restore this place in a safe manner.
(12/20 13:16:12) 'Veralun: but they closed everything
(12/20 13:16:12) Anthony: no but I would have to say in this day and age it matters not look at how the courts go
(12/20 13:16:25) Anthony: DS
(12/20 13:16:26) Dr. Kodama: You know I've never been one to hold back on opening up areas but...
(12/20 13:16:33) Emgee: i'd rather explore as things open...and not be in charge of searching parties to find lost rogue explorers
(12/20 13:16:38) Whilyam: but?
(12/20 13:16:43) susanszy: lol@Emgee
(12/20 13:17:06) Dr. Kodama: It won't hurt to have things closed for a bit while we check the extent of what happened yesterday.
(12/20 13:17:13) Dr. Kodama: It shouldn't be long.
(12/20 13:17:16) Whilyam: Hmm.. something that concerned me, Dr. is that without Douglas Sharper, what will become of Teledahn?
(12/20 13:17:22) Donna cheers
(12/20 13:17:32) Whilyam: Will it stay as is?
(12/20 13:17:37) Dr. Kodama: And some things simply aren't working so hopefully we'll get them going again soon.
(12/20 13:17:37) Matthew Miller: Doctor, does the DRC have an explination as to what exactly did happen yesterday?
(12/20 13:17:42) susanszy: yes, any idea where Sharper went?
(12/20 13:17:42) Emgee: What happened yesterday? Sisemic activity (-sp?)
(12/20 13:17:44) Anthony: How long would you say it will be Dr.
(12/20 13:17:46) Player added.
(12/20 13:17:49) Kedry: And what exactly DID happen? I heard you were checking your KI just before.
(12/20 13:18:04) Gadren: I noticed, Dr. Kodama, that you opened up your KI shortly before the incident. Did you see anything unusual?
(12/20 13:18:10) Ashtar: So what kind of changes have you seen so far that warrant the closures?
(12/20 13:18:10) Dr. Kodama: I was.
(12/20 13:18:33) Dr. Kodama: I was talking to Laxman.
(12/20 13:18:41) Kedry: Ahh...
(12/20 13:18:41) Altydwarber: my question is... when the bahro screem so loud is it possibble that the are nearby?
(12/20 13:18:43) Whilyam: He knewwhat was happening?
(12/20 13:19:10) Tweek: Alty> The Bahro are everywhere
(12/20 13:19:19) Dr. Kodama: He was seeing something weird in the Lattice.
(12/20 13:19:25) Gadren: Whatever happened, it affected our KIs, so hopefully Laxman can shed some light on it.
(12/20 13:19:35) Dr. Kodama: He's been working on them.
(12/20 13:19:36) Kedry: Too many questions...should we temporarily put the liasons in service?
(12/20 13:19:37) Whilyam: Ah. Nothing damaging he said in the KI message. That's good to know.
(12/20 13:19:38) Duncan (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(12/20 13:19:40) Altydwarber is looking for a hide away
(12/20 13:19:55) 'Veralun: do not be afraid Alty
(12/20 13:20:04) Matthew Miller: What did he see in the lattice?
(12/20 13:20:13) Altydwarber: well I still have the screem in my ears
(12/20 13:20:19) Tweek: salad dressing Wink
(12/20 13:20:20) Gadren: Is there something that the liaisons can do to assist?
(12/20 13:20:24) Nahuta: shorah all
(12/20 13:20:30) Matthew Miller: lol tweek
(12/20 13:20:31) Gadren: Shorah Nahuta
(12/20 13:20:38) Duncan: is there anything new to do?
(12/20 13:20:42) Kedry: I dunno...manage all the questions?
(12/20 13:20:44) Emgee: Is there a report available on the DRC website? Or an annoucement of some sort?
(12/20 13:20:47) 'Veralun: you have that in your easrs Tweek?
(12/20 13:20:48) Dr. Kodama: Help the new explorers
(12/20 13:20:55) Nahuta: hi Gadren
(12/20 13:21:03) Dr. Kodama: As far as yesterday? Not yet.
(12/20 13:21:10) Anthony: Yes are going to issue an update on exactly what happened
(12/20 13:21:18) Ashtar: I think most everyone has been helping with that Dr. K, at least what I have seen.
(12/20 13:21:23) Whilyam: Laxman already sent a KI message around explaining the barriers
(12/20 13:21:25) Ti'chelle: Is it safe for us to visit the ages and do our journey?
(12/20 13:21:42) Dr. Kodama: I would assume. And we don't have much control on that regardless...
(12/20 13:22:06) darkstar: I can't imagine theres been time to check yet
(12/20 13:22:11) Tweek: Ti> Should be I've been into Gahreesen, Gira and Kadish and it looks to be all well and good
(12/20 13:22:12) Emgee: Where is the best place to go to get info..?
(12/20 13:22:26) Anthony: Thats strange because I found Gar. blocked beyond the Ki station
(12/20 13:22:43) Ashtar: Guild of Greeters is a good start Emgee
(12/20 13:22:50) The Doctor: shorah, folks!
(12/20 13:22:51) Dr. Kodama: Agree. Guild of Greeters.
(12/20 13:22:52) Ti'chelle: Thanks Tweek.
(12/20 13:22:59) darkstar: using your own or the book in the hood?
(12/20 13:23:33) Ashtar: Where is he going?
(12/20 13:23:36) Whilyam: Don't look now, Dr.... but you're being followed
(12/20 13:23:42) Gadren laughs
(12/20 13:23:45) Dr. Kodama: Indeed.
(12/20 13:23:51) Ti'chelle: lemmings on Parade
(12/20 13:23:57) Anthony starts to laugh
(12/20 13:23:58) susanszy follows mindlessly
(12/20 13:24:01) Kedry: Don't mind us...Razz
(12/20 13:24:02) Dr. Kodama: Have any of you noticed changes?
(12/20 13:24:07) Emgee: It's cause your such a snappy dresser...and here we are in t-shirts Smile
(12/20 13:24:10) darkstar: it moves us away from the link in spot
(12/20 13:24:10) Whilyam: Where?
(12/20 13:24:15) Kedry: No water in the neighborhood fountains
(12/20 13:24:18) Matthew Miller: In the bevins, the imagers are gone for one
(12/20 13:24:22) susanszy: I noticed no heek in the hood
(12/20 13:24:25) Whilyam: I've noticed the barriers, that's for sure.
(12/20 13:24:29) Gadren: Well, there was a change on my Relto -- normally there are 4 pillars, but there was only 1 central one now
(12/20 13:24:33) Ti'chelle: I just linked down. Haven't had time to look.
(12/20 13:24:46) Anthony: yes
(12/20 13:24:49) Whilyam: I saw a new island and a well thing in my Relto as well
(12/20 13:24:53) Kedry: Oh, yeah, and the sone well, and two new islands.
(12/20 13:25:03) Kedry: Stone^
(12/20 13:25:03) Gadren nods his head
(12/20 13:25:07) Dr. Kodama: Right, I think I was aware of most of those.
(12/20 13:25:09) Dr. Kodama: Strange.
(12/20 13:25:13) 'Veralun: we need some light here
(12/20 13:25:35) Anthony: sadly I forgot my lantern
(12/20 13:25:41) Gadren: On a slightly more personal note, Dr. Laxman, how has your perception of the Bahro changed after this incident?
(12/20 13:25:43) darkstar: and odd bridge arrangement
(12/20 13:25:50) Tweek: I've noticed a few changes, floating stones, new island
(12/20 13:25:54) Kedry: Is something holding up Sutherland?
(12/20 13:26:17) darkstar: seemed to me the Bahro where as surprised as we where
(12/20 13:26:20) Dr. Kodama: I don't know of anything specific holding her up.
(12/20 13:26:22) Ashtar: Did it scare the DRC as well, a show of power they don't poccess?
(12/20 13:26:51) Ti'chelle: Maybe then it wasn't the Bahro that linked everyone.
(12/20 13:27:02) Dr. Kodama: I'm not sure "scared" is the right word.
(12/20 13:27:09) Kedry: That sounded a rather snide tone, Ashtar...
(12/20 13:27:15) Matthew Miller: Who would have the power to link everyone if it wasn't the Bahro?
(12/20 13:27:22) Whilyam: Yeesha
(12/20 13:27:26) Gadren: What else could it have been, Ti'chelle? What, other than the Bahro, possesses the power to link hundreds of people at once?
(12/20 13:27:27) Anthony: Maybe the maker is angered at us disturbing the city of d'ni
(12/20 13:27:29) susanszy: exactly, Whil
(12/20 13:27:37) Ashtar: It wasn't Kedry, just an obvious observation.
(12/20 13:27:40) Whilyam: but I'm positive it was Bahro
(12/20 13:27:42) susanszy: and she said she was coming
(12/20 13:27:44) Ti'chelle: He who comes?
(12/20 13:27:51) Whilyam: Last I heard, Yeesha didn't sound THAT raspy
(12/20 13:27:57) darkstar: Bow that is the question
(12/20 13:27:57) Dr. Kodama: Hmm... well I better resume checking out things. Good day.
(12/20 13:27:58) Matthew Miller: Thats just silly religious mombo jumbo Anthony, bah
(12/20 13:28:07) Whilyam: Good day, Dr.
(12/20 13:28:07) The Doctor: the bahro have shown in other places just what sort of power they do have.
(12/20 13:28:07) Matthew Miller: Good Day 
(12/20 13:28:11) Emgee: Thanks for your time Dr. K
(12/20 13:28:11) Gadren: Good luck, Dr. Kodama
(12/20 13:28:15) susanszy: bye Dr.
(12/20 13:28:16) Ti'chelle: Good day Dr. K. Nice seeing you.
(12/20 13:28:16) Donna: Thank you Dr.!
(12/20 13:28:19) Tweek: I dunno, with that Burden to deal with, she's proberbly on 50 a day and knocking back the rum
