(12/22 17:58:14) Kimmie: hello Marie
(12/22 17:58:17) amonre: evening, marie
(12/22 17:58:26) NZman: hi, Marie
(12/22 17:58:50) Kimmie: welcome to GoG bevin Marie
(12/22 17:58:56) Ashelbane: Shorah to all.
(12/22 17:59:00) Ashelbane waves
(12/22 17:59:06) Marie Sutherland: I was getting too many private messages to reply to them :)
(12/22 17:59:20) Ian Watson: How's the cavern looking? I know there were some fears of instability after the Bahro scream the other day.
(12/22 17:59:33) vid: You're a very popular lady, I'm sure. I know all the ResEngs want your phone number in their KI :P
(12/22 18:00:43) amonre: Why do I always become hungry at night? It's like I need something after dinner. >_<
(12/22 18:01:22) Junee: It depends on how long after dinner it is ;)
(12/22 18:01:31) Marie Sutherland: Ian, we're still in the process of determine what state everything is in.
(12/22 18:01:54) vid: I think I'm going to start trying to make a chart of the splitting occuring in Ae'gura... it might be helpful...
(12/22 18:02:03) Marie Sutherland: So far, things don't look too bad, but some of us have learned to be more cautious than others.
(12/22 18:02:11) amonre: splitting?
(12/22 18:02:44) Ian Watson: I can certainly appreciate that.
(12/22 18:02:46) Veralun: hi All
(12/22 18:03:02) vid: Yeah.... Victor was speaking about the city being broken up earlier. Different people going to different parts of the city, and for all purposes it seeming to be a different city altogether.
(12/22 18:03:04) J'iim: victor mention the discovery of multiple instance of the City. However the nexus seemed to rooted in the one we know
(12/22 18:03:30) Shamgar cheers
(12/22 18:03:42) vid: That makes sense, since the Nexus would carry D'ni books... while it's Yeesha's books that take people to different "versions"
(12/22 18:03:51) Marie Sutherland: I was actually on my way to the city to talk about that, when I received the private messages.
(12/22 18:03:54) Maurus: well, that's true...
(12/22 18:04:01) Butch: Marie: can you give us an estimate of how much of the city the DRC has reviewed since the incident?
(12/22 18:04:09) J'iim: good point. Yeesha played a prominent role in Victor's talk
(12/22 18:04:13) Ian Watson: If there's any way for us to help with repairs or such, I'm sure many of us would jump at the chance.
(12/22 18:04:22) vid: Marie, any information you can share regarding that would be most appreciated.
(12/22 18:04:27) Maurus nods his head
(12/22 18:04:55) J'iim: however he never said when the barriers would come down <frown>
(12/22 18:04:56) Marie Sutherland: Thanks for the offer, Ian.
(12/22 18:05:26) Marie Sutherland: Butch, I don't have an overall estimate. Different folks are looking at different areas.
(12/22 18:05:31) Dusante: Wow Marie, and so many of you, haven't seen you all for a long time! Hello!
(12/22 18:05:50) Marie Sutherland: Engberg might have a more comprehensive view of the overall picture.
(12/22 18:05:53) Dan'ni: So what interesting are you currently working on, Marie?
(12/22 18:06:16) Julian Lapis: Hiya folks
(12/22 18:06:27) Dusante waves
(12/22 18:07:02) Marie Sutherland: Dan'ni - at the moment splitting my time between Eder Delin and Ae'gura.
(12/22 18:07:02) Ayli waves
(12/22 18:07:10) vid: Dr Sutherland, of course we both know that a lot of explorers have been carrying the Relto book that we found years ago for... well.. years. But a lot of new explorers have them also, and they don't seem to be in the cleft anymore. Is the DRC supplying Relto books as a safety measure now?
(12/22 18:07:20) Julian Lapis: Shorah Marie!
(12/22 18:07:50) Maurus: Marie, what do you think of Delin and Tsoghal?
(12/22 18:08:08) Marie Sutherland: vid - no, we're not supplying them. We're not opposed to them, but we're not distributing them ourselves.
(12/22 18:08:35) Junee: Is there any chance we might see Eder Delin soon?
(12/22 18:09:11) Marie Sutherland: Maurus - I'm particularly fond of Eder Delin, but Eder Tsogal is nice, too.
(12/22 18:09:20) Julian Lapis: Marie, whats your personal take on the events of the 19th? Do you think that we, as explorers, are in any danger?
(12/22 18:10:30) Marie Sutherland: Junee - Yes. Probably. Of course, "soon" is a relative term.
(12/22 18:11:06) Marie Sutherland: Given that we've been working on it for months, what seems like "soon" to us may not seem like "soon" to you.
(12/22 18:11:34) Dan'ni: So "soon" as in weeks? or months?
(12/22 18:11:45) Ian Watson: Given that many of us have been involved in the cavern going on three years now, six months could be "soon," and I'd be happy with that.
(12/22 18:11:54) Marie Sutherland: Julian - I hope the explorers are not in danger. We're certainly doing our best to take what precautions we can.
(12/22 18:11:55) Dan'ni: Cause I'm sure you 're not referring to days. :)
(12/22 18:12:13) Ayli: As Mr. Rand likes to say: "In a future" :)
(12/22 18:12:24) Marie Sutherland: But it's impossible to know for sure how much danger any of us are in.
(12/22 18:13:14) Marie Sutherland: Ian - given that definition of "soon", I think Delin will definitely be available within that time frame. :)
(12/22 18:13:23) Ian Watson cheers
(12/22 18:13:46) Julian Lapis grins like a goodun
(12/22 18:14:31) Dan'ni: One thing that I've always been curious. Did the DRC find out where the Bahro screams actually come from?
(12/22 18:14:48) Jeff Klinger: Bahro, obviously. ;)
(12/22 18:14:52) vid: I always assumed from Bahro :)
(12/22 18:14:57) Ian Watson snorts
(12/22 18:14:58) Marie Sutherland: But before Eder Delin... what I actually was heading to the city to talk about...
(12/22 18:14:58) Ayli: What are the biggest concerns at the DRC at the moment, Ms. Southerland?
(12/22 18:15:01) Dan'ni: Yeah but they must be hiding somewhere close
(12/22 18:15:04) Dan'ni: ;)
(12/22 18:15:13) Kam Uraki: If I might say something. I'm glad you enjoyed our DRC Public Safty Association videos, Ms. Sutherland
(12/22 18:15:16) Ian Watson: Yes, Marie?
(12/22 18:15:37) Kam Uraki: Vortmax told me he passed them along to you. :)
(12/22 18:16:22) Marie Sutherland: I know Victor was in earlier. We have been discussing trying to get the doors to the Gallery open.
(12/22 18:16:36) Ayli: That is great :)
(12/22 18:16:38) vid cheers
(12/22 18:16:38) Dusante: Wow that is great news!
(12/22 18:16:39) Julian Lapis: Interesting!
(12/22 18:16:43) Dan'ni: Awesome!
(12/22 18:16:44) Veralun: that would be great!
(12/22 18:16:46) Ian Watson: Oh. Wow. That'd be nice; I don't think we've seen them open... well, ever.
(12/22 18:16:49) Kam Uraki: Oh really? I thought that was not possible.
(12/22 18:16:50) Dan'ni: About time too! :)
(12/22 18:16:52) Ural: Awesome!!
(12/22 18:16:52) Jeff Klinger claps his hands
(12/22 18:17:07) Dan'ni: Any success with that, Marie?
(12/22 18:17:08) Kam Uraki: Did you guys just find the keys or something? ;)
(12/22 18:17:14) Julian Lapis: What are the practicailities? Is there a lot of work needed?
(12/22 18:17:23) Marie Sutherland: We're hoping that we'll have them working sometime next week.
(12/22 18:17:32) Dan'ni: Awesome!
(12/22 18:17:33) Jeff Klinger cheers
(12/22 18:17:35) Veralun cheers
(12/22 18:17:36) Brandeline: Anything is possible with a couple sticks of dynamite.. but they are awful nice doors to be blown off their hinges. ;)
(12/22 18:17:38) Junee: Nice :)
(12/22 18:17:41) Julian Lapis: Now THIS is legendary
(12/22 18:17:50) Ayli thinks its an excellent news :)
(12/22 18:17:51) Marie Sutherland: Something for you all to be looking forward to. :D
(12/22 18:17:55) Kam Uraki: lol Brand
(12/22 18:18:03) kami: dang you guys have been on the journey
(12/22 18:18:05) BrettM: Dr. Sutherland, have you had any reports of missing people?
(12/22 18:18:05) Veralun: will us give that an extra instance to the city Marie?
(12/22 18:18:07) Dan'ni: So the rest of the city will also be opened soon then?
(12/22 18:18:15) Ian Watson: That would be fantastic. I would assume that would also mean access to the second floor of the Gallery?
(12/22 18:18:19) Kam Uraki: I'll consider that a nice holiday gift from the DRC
(12/22 18:18:20) Marie Sutherland: Brand - um, yes, we'd prefer to get them working without damaging them.
(12/22 18:18:52) Brandeline scuffs. Sorry, couldn't resist. :)
(12/22 18:19:08) kami: victor said that several of you have taken the journey marie.....did yu??
(12/22 18:19:15) Marie Sutherland: BrettM - I was very concerned about that, in fact. But no one I've asked has known of anyone missing.
(12/22 18:19:24) BrettM thanks you
(12/22 18:19:37) amonre: always travel in pairs ;)
(12/22 18:19:40) Julian Lapis: How has Kodama-san been today? He sounded a little riled yesterday.
(12/22 18:19:41) Kam Uraki: Ms. Sutherland, sort of an odd question. What is the purpose of that light on the Arch?
(12/22 18:19:48) Marie Sutherland: If you know of anyone who's still missing, please let me know.
(12/22 18:20:08) Veralun: we miss DR Watson
(12/22 18:20:14) J'iim crashes to desktop with a locked up KI
(12/22 18:20:19) Kam Uraki: Well, I'm missing my keys, but that's not as important ;)
(12/22 18:20:21) Tweek: Phil too
(12/22 18:20:38) Marie Sutherland: Veralun - We do too.
(12/22 18:20:50) Julian Lapis: and that scurilous rogue Sharper :D
(12/22 18:21:00) Veralun: I hope he will return soon
(12/22 18:21:00) kami: douglas???...or did he get fired or something?
(12/22 18:21:18) Kam Uraki: Actually Ms Sutherland. If you ask me, you've all done a fine job without Dr. Watson
(12/22 18:21:33) Kam Uraki: In fact an awesome job
(12/22 18:21:55) Ian Watson: Indeed. I certainly can't complain.
(12/22 18:22:00) Jeff Klinger: Still, it would be good to see him back.
(12/22 18:22:01) Dusante: Yeah you guys have been doing great, your work doesn't go un appreaciated despite what a few might have been saying
(12/22 18:22:03) Marie Sutherland: Kam - thank you. As Dr. Watson often said "We do the best we can with what we have."
(12/22 18:22:06) Anonymous Coward: my KI just broke...wait till I get my hands on Victor..
(12/22 18:22:22) Marie Sutherland: We've tried to keep to that philosophy, even in his absence.
(12/22 18:22:38) Julian Lapis: It really does feel like things are moving forward. A lot of that is due to the DRC.
(12/22 18:22:39) Natika: shorah Eleri
(12/22 18:22:48) Kam Uraki: Communication between the explorers and the DRC is much better, which has fostered a lot of trust
(12/22 18:22:48) Julian Lapis: Shorah Eleri!
(12/22 18:22:51) vid: Dr Sutherland, have you heard much regarding the fountains? The water flow is sorely missed.
(12/22 18:23:03) Eleri: Shourah, everybuggy
(12/22 18:23:06) Ian Watson: I'm not a Doctor, but I'm certainly a Watson, if people need one. ;)
(12/22 18:23:06) Kam Uraki: Ah, one of the Liaisons arrives. Shorah Eleri
(12/22 18:23:16) Mookie: Shorah everyone!
(12/22 18:23:17) Julian Lapis: We'll bear that in mind Ian.
(12/22 18:23:20) Marie Sutherland laughs
(12/22 18:23:22) vid: Mookah!
(12/22 18:23:25) Mookie: veeks!
(12/22 18:23:32) Kam Uraki: I'm not a Doctor, but I play one on the internet...
(12/22 18:23:35) Natika: Mookie!!!!
(12/22 18:23:48) Marie Sutherland: well, I hate to chat and run, but I do need to be getting back to work.
(12/22 18:23:48) Mookie: Hallo!
(12/22 18:23:49) Kam Uraki wonders if anyone will get the 80's joke
(12/22 18:23:51) Natika cheers
(12/22 18:23:55) Julian Lapis: Im not a doctor, but I know a lot of them...
(12/22 18:23:59) Linkin' Imp: What a surprise
(12/22 18:24:05) Linkin' Imp rolls eyes
(12/22 18:24:10) Mookie: Okay

(12/22 18:24:24) Ayli: Thanks for stopping by, we are always happy to see you or any of the DRC members :)
(12/22 18:24:30) Dusante: Having the Liasons has definetly openned the channels between the DRC and explorers it's much appreciated
(12/22 18:24:30) Mookie: Aye

(12/22 18:25:28) BrettM: Nude Luthor with a Santa hat?? How .... odd.
(12/22 18:25:29) Julian Lapis has just lost his final trace of sanity
(12/22 18:25:46) Linkin' Imp: Merry ho ho
(12/22 18:25:51) Julian Lapis: How do Miss Eleri
(12/22 18:25:53) Marie Sutherland: What can I do for you, Linkin' Imp?
(12/22 18:25:58) amonre: I thought you didn't have that, JL ;)
(12/22 18:26:16) Kam Uraki: Hey give the woman some room guys
(12/22 18:26:17) Linkin' Imp: Oh. nothin' i just wanted to say hello
(12/22 18:26:26) Julian Lapis: My god... does the entire cavern think I am psychotic?
(12/22 18:26:30) Dusante: lol imp love the clothes
(12/22 18:26:36) Kam Uraki: You could do something for me!
(12/22 18:26:39) Tink tink pricks up ears
(12/22 18:26:40) Marie Sutherland: The other day, you came to a hood just as I was leaving and seemed hurt I had to leave.
(12/22 18:26:45) Kam Uraki gets out autograph book
(12/22 18:26:56) Eleri: no, Jul, just a little wonky ;)
(12/22 18:26:57) Marie Sutherland: I went to your hood later to say hello, but you were not there.
(12/22 18:26:59) Linkin' Imp: Oh. i'm a bit hypersensitive.
(12/22 18:27:02) Linkin' Imp blushes
(12/22 18:27:20) Tink tink wonders where that job had gone
(12/22 18:27:24) Julian Lapis: Wonky... you make me sound like a crooked table
(12/22 18:27:24) Marie Sutherland: Well, it's nothing personal, I assure you.
(12/22 18:27:29) Linkin' Imp: I can't join any hoods so i was getting upset
(12/22 18:27:31) Kam Uraki: Ask for a hug Link :)
(12/22 18:27:33) Marie Sutherland: But I do need to get back to work.
