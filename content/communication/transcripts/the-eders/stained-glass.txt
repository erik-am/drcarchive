(02/22 21:20:22) The Broken Light: Shorah, large group of people.

(02/22 21:22:21) Volki: shorah all
(02/22 21:22:37) Ti'an: So, is there a specific reason for your visit today?
(02/22 21:23:00) Kelm: Hello Mr Engberg how are you today?
(02/22 21:23:01) White Rose: Wait
(02/22 21:23:18) Michael Engberg: Actually, there is, in fact.
(02/22 21:23:35) Ti'an: Care to share with us, Mr. E?
(02/22 21:23:55) Michael Engberg: I have an interesting opportunity to discuss with you.
(02/22 21:24:04) Erik: i'm listening...
(02/22 21:24:06) Moiety Jean 's ears perk up
(02/22 21:24:09) Ti'an: We're all ears
(02/22 21:24:10) The Broken Light: As am I :)
(02/22 21:24:11) A'drian: All ears.

(02/22 21:24:24) Jimbo: tell us
(02/22 21:24:30) BobLishman: please
(02/22 21:24:39) Myst'Aken wonder's what it could be
(02/22 21:24:53) Michael Engberg: You have probably noticed the stained-glass "windows" in the 'hoods of the Gahreesen Age.
(02/22 21:24:54) Kelm: Please give the man a chance
(02/22 21:25:02) BobLishman: yes
(02/22 21:25:03) Erik nods his head
(02/22 21:25:06) A'drian: Yes, they're beautiful.
(02/22 21:25:07) The Broken Light: Yes Mr. Engberg
(02/22 21:25:09) Sorceress: Yes, they're very pretty.
(02/22 21:25:09) BobLishman nods
(02/22 21:25:15) Ti'an: Yes..some are lit, some not
(02/22 21:25:16) Jimbo: no
(02/22 21:25:17) Myst'Aken nods his head
(02/22 21:25:18) BobLishman: and different
(02/22 21:25:32) Lule: do we get to break them?
(02/22 21:25:43) Sorceress: Ack!
(02/22 21:25:48) The Broken Light: If you need a window cleaner, I have 4+ years of experience.
(02/22 21:25:55) Lule: :>)
(02/22 21:25:58) The Broken Light: :)
(02/22 21:26:02) Jimbo: are u opening the wall....i want that rubber suit
(02/22 21:26:11) Lule: nice backs!
(02/22 21:26:12) Erik: let Mr. Engberg finish please
(02/22 21:26:14) The Broken Light: Settle down, guys.
(02/22 21:26:16) Michael Engberg: We have recently found similar stained-glass windows for Eder Tsogal, but they need to be restored before they can be displayed.
(02/22 21:26:33) Lule: I need to finish tsogal!
(02/22 21:26:33) BobLishman: please ...let Mr Engberg speak
(02/22 21:26:44) Erik: nice!
(02/22 21:26:51) Myst'Aken: How can we help ?
(02/22 21:26:51) Moiety Jean: Ooh. Well, any task you'd care to set out I'm sure we'll be glad to take on.
(02/22 21:26:58) The Broken Light: Oh wow! They must be beautiful
(02/22 21:27:06) BobLishman: we're happy to help
(02/22 21:27:07) Johan: stt, if we are saying nothing, then mr engberg can tell it
(02/22 21:27:08) Ti'an: Yes, we'd be glad to help
(02/22 21:27:12) White Rose: Anyone need help?
(02/22 21:27:37) Sorceress: It must've been a popular Garden Age to warrant more windows.
(02/22 21:27:37) Michael Engberg: We were thinking that that is a project that the explorers might like to tackle.
(02/22 21:27:46) Kelm: Please give the man a chance to speak we can comment afterwards
(02/22 21:27:58) A'drian: I'm happy to volunteer in any way I can.
(02/22 21:28:03) BobLishman: me too
(02/22 21:28:05) Lule: me too
(02/22 21:28:08) Sorceress: Sounds great! What do we need to do?
(02/22 21:28:09) White Rose: Sounds interesting Michael
(02/22 21:28:10) Moiety Jean: I'm one of numerous explorers raring for a chance to assist the restoration. This is wonderful.
(02/22 21:28:15) A'drian: I'm sure all of us are.
(02/22 21:28:20) Deathsbedbug: tell us how to help, and you'll have more helpers than you can handle :)
(02/22 21:28:25) Kelm: What a waste of time
(02/22 21:28:34) White Rose: I love todo that kind of thing
(02/22 21:29:08) Erik: I would love to do some restoration work.
(02/22 21:29:09) Ragdrazi: What you would be having us do?
(02/22 21:29:27) Ragdrazi: And what are the risks?
(02/22 21:29:36) Kelm: Listen to the man first the comment after wards
(02/22 21:29:36) A'drian: Glass cuts, i'm sure.
(02/22 21:29:42) Michael Engberg: Feel free to restore the stained glass as best as you think it would have looked
(02/22 21:29:43) Ragdrazi starts to laugh
(02/22 21:29:57) White Rose: Where is it which Bevin
(02/22 21:30:01) BobLishman: may we ask how?
(02/22 21:30:05) White Rose: And how do we restore it
(02/22 21:30:17) A'drian: Where is it located?
(02/22 21:30:20) Ti'an: Where might we find the unrestored windows?
(02/22 21:30:23) Myst'Aken: Where will we find these windows ?
(02/22 21:30:24) White Rose: Can we click on the pieces to restore it
(02/22 21:30:42) Michael Engberg: and send a picture of the restored window to info@drcsite.org
(02/22 21:30:50) A'drian: Ahhh
(02/22 21:30:50) The Broken Light: What I believe he means is we are to submit to the DRC a diagram of how we think the stained glass window should look
(02/22 21:30:58) Myst'Aken: I see
(02/22 21:31:04) Moiety Jean: Interesting. So it is also a creative opportunity!
(02/22 21:31:09) Erik: Sounds great!
(02/22 21:31:11) The Broken Light: I am very excited.
(02/22 21:31:16) Ragdrazi: Arts and crafts.
(02/22 21:31:17) BobLishman: is that correct mr engberg?
(02/22 21:31:20) White Rose: Which age Delin or Tsogahl
(02/22 21:31:21) Ragdrazi laughs
(02/22 21:31:26) The Broken Light: Tsogahl
(02/22 21:31:27) Deathsbedbug: for those of us just arriving, which windows is being referred to?
(02/22 21:31:34) White Rose: And where is it in the age?
(02/22 21:31:34) Ti'an: An excellent opportunity for the creative among us. Thank you Mr. E.
(02/22 21:31:54) Moiety Jean: Thank you very much, Mr. Engberg. This is a welcome opportunity.
(02/22 21:32:00) Sorceress: Does it matter what medium the pics are in? I'm lost with Photoshop :(
(02/22 21:32:17) A'drian: Mr. Engberg, any specifications for the restoration?
(02/22 21:32:23) The Broken Light: You know the window above the Gahreesen book in Bevin? We're to submit how we believe the window above the Tsogahl book should look.
(02/22 21:32:28) Lule: Mr. E--do we need to have finished tsogal? I've helped others thru but not have been thru myself!
(02/22 21:32:31) Ti'an: Would there be compensation of some sort for the best efforts, Mr. E?
(02/22 21:32:34) Deathsbedbug: ty broken
(02/22 21:32:35) Erik: Thank you Mr Engberg for letting us help with the restoration.
(02/22 21:32:42) The Broken Light: Np Deathsbedbug
(02/22 21:32:51) BobLishman: presumably jpeg format
(02/22 21:32:56) Ragdrazi: What materals can we use to resurch to insure historial acuracy.
(02/22 21:33:06) Michael Engberg: We'll collect the images until March 26th and then select some of them for display in the 'hoods with Eder Tsogal.
(02/22 21:33:34) The Broken Light: We should probably use the Gahreesen window as a guideline
(02/22 21:33:39) White Rose: where are the pieces located in the age?
(02/22 21:33:45) Erik: Is there a limit for restorating windows? Or could you send multiple entries?
(02/22 21:34:01) Ragdrazi: Two types on the Gahreesen window aren't there?
(02/22 21:34:07) Deathsbedbug: yes
(02/22 21:34:12) Ti'an: Ahhh....pubilicity...the best compensation an artist can get :)
(02/22 21:34:16) Michael Engberg: We'll be adding more specific details to the drcsite in the near future.
(02/22 21:34:24) Sorceress: Okay!
(02/22 21:34:25) The Broken Light: Thank you very much, Mr. Engberg.
(02/22 21:34:28) The Broken Light bows
(02/22 21:34:38) Myst'Aken: Which would be preferred the single or triple pane version ?
(02/22 21:34:39) Ti'an: We'll be sure to get the word out
(02/22 21:34:39) Sorceress: Thanks, this sounds like it's gonna be fun :)
(02/22 21:34:40) White Rose: Where are the pieces located in the age?
(02/22 21:35:07) Lule: is there a way to read the scrolled text back upwards?
(02/22 21:35:08) White Rose: Are they scattered and we have to find them or are they all in one area
(02/22 21:35:14) Moiety Jean: I trust you have technicians available to craft the glass once designs are chosen?
(02/22 21:35:24) Lule: Oh, found it!
(02/22 21:35:52) The Broken Light: They have the technicians to restore an underground civilization. I'm sure they can craft glass :)
(02/22 21:35:53) White Rose: Reply how many do you have to help?
(02/22 21:36:04) Moiety Jean: Good point, TBL
(02/22 21:36:11) Ragdrazi: Or repair it rather.
(02/22 21:36:11) Kelm: I thought i heard him say there will be more details on the DRC site in the near future what else did you want to know?
(02/22 21:36:32) Michael Engberg: You may submit as many designs as you like.
(02/22 21:36:43) White Rose: You need at least 8 it si too difficult with less
(02/22 21:36:50) White Rose: It is
(02/22 21:36:52) The Broken Light: Awesome.
(02/22 21:37:05) The Broken Light: Thank you very much for this opportunity, Mr. Engberg.
(02/22 21:37:07) Moiety Jean: For those not so artistically inclined, how soon might they be able to help again with The Great Zero?
(02/22 21:37:09) Erik: Nice.
(02/22 21:37:13) Michael Engberg: Thanks. I'm glad it's something some of you are interested in.
(02/22 21:37:20) The Broken Light cheers
(02/22 21:37:26) Sorceress breaks out her colored pencils
(02/22 21:37:35) Moiety Jean: Any opportunity to assist is interesting. :)
(02/22 21:37:42) Michael Engberg: Moiety Jean, I'm really not sure. Sorry.
(02/22 21:38:15) Moiety Jean: That's okay. Please keep working. We know it takes time.
(02/22 21:38:34) The Broken Light: I really don't mean to be bothersome, but do you have and comments regarding the recent supposed Yeesha summoning?
(02/22 21:38:35) Sorceress: For accuracy, I heard Delin's door didn't "appear" in the Age until some time after you explored it. Was it the same for Tsogal's door?
(02/22 21:38:47) White Rose: Paulpp needs help with Tsogahl in Lofres Bevin anyone want to help him
(02/22 21:38:55) Lule: Well, this should hold our interest until THAT's fixed!
(02/22 21:39:00) Ragdrazi raises eyebrows
(02/22 21:39:30) Lule: I mean, the Great Zero
(02/22 21:39:42) Ragdrazi: Did the DRC release Delin and Tsogal with the Journey Cloths inside?
(02/22 21:39:55) Ragdrazi: Did they know they were inside?
(02/22 21:40:51) A'drian: I'd be happy to help you lift those bothersome barrels from infront of the Museum.
(02/22 21:41:03) Ragdrazi starts to laugh
(02/22 21:41:12) Ragdrazi: Another task for the not so artistically inclined.
(02/22 21:41:14) Michael Engberg: Thanks for the offer, A'drian.
