(02/21 00:01:03) Kedry: Hi, Nick!
(02/21 00:01:03) Eleri: I sat in the Tsoghal one for a good 10 minutes the other night.
(02/21 00:01:05) gelf56: missed
(02/21 00:01:10) Junee: Hi Nick
(02/21 00:01:12) Eleri: the door is transparent from the inside!
(02/21 00:01:30) gelf56: nick you need to wear a hat!
(02/21 00:01:30) Nick White: What's up guys?
(02/21 00:01:37) Junee: cold feet lol
(02/21 00:01:41) Nick White: Need a jacket.
(02/21 00:01:43) Eleri: snowflakes! But they're coming down
(02/21 00:01:43) Kedry: Well, if you didn't notice, it's snowing! :D
(02/21 00:01:43) Gadren: not much...enjoying the nice weather
(02/21 00:01:48) Gadren: brr
(02/21 00:01:53) Nick White: Told you the storm was coming....
(02/21 00:02:03) Eleri: wimps. who needs shoes!
(02/21 00:02:08) Gadren: heh...is this what Yeesha meant?
(02/21 00:02:09) gelf56: the storm wasn't to bad then?
(02/21 00:02:17) Kedry: Good thing I'm dressed for the occasion.
(02/21 00:02:18) Gadren: Eleri, are you a hobbit?
(02/21 00:02:23) Nick White: No not too bad.
(02/21 00:02:24) Whilyam: Whoa!
(02/21 00:02:29) Junee: Hi Whilyam
(02/21 00:02:39) Gadren: hi whilyam
(02/21 00:02:41) Kedry throws a snowball at Nick
(02/21 00:02:50) Eleri: might it snow more? Or is this about it?
(02/21 00:03:02) Gadren: i notice the floating statue isn't rotating...there goes that one theory about it controlling the weather
(02/21 00:03:05) Nick White wipes snow off of his face and gets mad.
(02/21 00:03:09) Eleri flops and makes a snow angel
(02/21 00:03:09) Kedry: Hehe
(02/21 00:03:28) Junee: I wonder where the other birds migrated
(02/21 00:03:32) Whilyam: Wow... very interesting
(02/21 00:03:41) Nick White: Anyone seen "Heaven"?
(02/21 00:03:51) Gadren: What do you mean?
(02/21 00:03:55) Whilyam: No.
(02/21 00:04:01) Gadren pokes himself in the arm
(02/21 00:04:01) Kedry: This has hapened where I live on the surface before. All the birds think the snow will never come and stay. :P
(02/21 00:04:05) Gadren: I think I'm still alive
(02/21 00:04:17) Nick White: Some girl's name.
(02/21 00:04:24) Gadren: Oh
(02/21 00:04:31) Whilyam taunts you
(02/21 00:04:31) Whilyam: Nick's girlfriend :P
(02/21 00:04:32) Eleri: No, haven't seen her
(02/21 00:04:36) Gadren: Shorah Halvor
(02/21 00:04:43) gelf56: you got her ki number?
(02/21 00:04:45) Rivenorth: it's so very nice - snoooow:)
(02/21 00:04:45) Kedry: Hi, Halvor!
(02/21 00:04:51) Junee: shorah halvor
(02/21 00:04:54) Nick White: Yeah.
(02/21 00:05:01) Nick White: Of course.
(02/21 00:05:05) Gadren rolls Whilyam into a giant snowball and pushes him down the stairs
(02/21 00:05:13) Whilyam: EEeeeeeeee....
(02/21 00:05:28) Rivenorth: ok
(02/21 00:05:37) Gadren: Shorah Tweek!
(02/21 00:05:37) Whilyam: Hey, Nick. Blake was in the City earlier
(02/21 00:05:38) Halvor: what's up Nick?
(02/21 00:05:38) Nick White covers up some yellow snow.
(02/21 00:05:45) Gadren: O_o
(02/21 00:05:47) Junee throws a big snowball on Gadren
(02/21 00:06:00) Kedry: Hey, Nick. Could you hold still for a sec? :P
(02/21 00:06:02) Gadren flinches
(02/21 00:06:06) Eleri: *chuckle*
(02/21 00:06:07) Halvor throws snowballs at you
(02/21 00:06:08) Nick White: Not really.
(02/21 00:06:13) Gadren starts to laugh
(02/21 00:06:22) Whilyam: Blake said that he'd see "what excuse" the DRC had for opening the Museum and putting barrels in front of it. Do you know what happened?
(02/21 00:06:25) gelf56: to cold to hold still
(02/21 00:06:33) Nick White: What?
(02/21 00:06:38) Nick White: Haven't heard that one.
(02/21 00:06:41) Whilyam: Hmm
(02/21 00:06:48) Nick White: I don't think we opened it.
(02/21 00:06:50) Whilyam: Blake said he was going to a meeting
(02/21 00:06:59) Kedry: Well, the door's opening, anyway.
(02/21 00:07:06) Whilyam: "I'll see what excuse they have for that."
(02/21 00:07:19) Nick White: Not sure.
(02/21 00:07:21) Whilyam: The door tothe museum is open, with two barricades in front
(02/21 00:07:23) Tweek: that could explain why he ran when I asked him a question about accounts
(02/21 00:07:28) Nick White: What's this Yeesha thing going on?
(02/21 00:07:34) Gadren: dunno
(02/21 00:07:44) Gadren: apparently people are trying to call Yeesha or something like that
(02/21 00:07:44) Nick White: Where is it?
(02/21 00:07:46) Whilyam: 40+ people making a spiral shape in sil oh wet's bevin
(02/21 00:07:48) Tweek: the explorers are gathering to try and get Yeesha to show up in the Cavern
(02/21 00:07:50) Gadren: I'm not big into seances
(02/21 00:07:52) Kedry: Yeesha's new journey. :D
(02/21 00:07:59) Nick White: Me neither Gadren.
(02/21 00:08:05) Nick White: I might go and make fun of them though.
(02/21 00:08:05) Eleri: it's a nifty idea, though
(02/21 00:08:20) Whilyam starts to laugh
(02/21 00:08:20) Gadren: Well, it gets people into the Cavern...that's good
(02/21 00:08:23) Nick White: It's nifty to make a symbol I guess.
(02/21 00:08:30) Junee: yeah, it makes some nice art :)
(02/21 00:08:45) gelf56:
(02/21 00:08:46) Kedry: Haven't seen snow in a while...
(02/21 00:08:55) Eleri: the Bahro will come and make bemused noises at them
(02/21 00:08:56) Gadren: I've seen too much of it back at home
(02/21 00:09:02) Nick White: Well I suppose I need to go and check it out.
(02/21 00:09:06) Tweek wonders if the DRC would notice him selling Linking Books on the sly to raise some funds
(02/21 00:09:07) Whilyam: So, you have any idea as to why the Museum door is open, Nick?
(02/21 00:09:07) Rivenorth: i am used to snow - i am from Norway
(02/21 00:09:19) Gadren: But we always got the snow on the weekends, so no snow days, but I have to shovel
(02/21 00:09:19) Nick White: I didn't even know it was open.
(02/21 00:09:24) Whilyam: Hmm
(02/21 00:09:26) Nick White: Better look at that too.
(02/21 00:09:26) Whilyam: Curious
(02/21 00:09:35) Nick White: That's two things I have to do.
(02/21 00:09:39) Nick White: I better run.
(02/21 00:09:42) Nick White: Talk to you guys later.
(02/21 00:09:44) Kedry: Only two? :P
(02/21 00:09:45) Tweek: cya nick
(02/21 00:09:47) Nick White: Have fun in the snow...
(02/21 00:09:49) Gadren: OK, good luck :)
(02/21 00:09:50) Kedry: See you later.
(02/21 00:09:51) Whilyam: Shorah, Nick.
(02/21 00:09:52) Eleri: Maybe Engberg is futzing with is, like the Gallery door
(02/21 00:09:53) Nick White: Two I can let you know about.
