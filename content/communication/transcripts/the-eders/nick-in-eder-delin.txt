(02/16 23:11:46) Nick White: What's up guys?
(02/16 23:11:51) Lord Chaos: Shorah, Nick.
(02/16 23:11:55) Cycreim: We were just talking about what Laxman said
(02/16 23:11:57) Professor Askew: Hello, there, Nick.
(02/16 23:12:02) juk: so what is happening here?
(02/16 23:12:04) Nick White: Delin is so much nicer.
(02/16 23:12:08) Nick White: In my opinion.
(02/16 23:12:18) Cycreim: It's pretty rad
(02/16 23:12:19) Professor Askew: Yes, very nice here.
(02/16 23:12:35) Nick White: So what's this rumor thing?
(02/16 23:12:45) Professor Askew: Rumor?
(02/16 23:12:48) Tayrtahn: that storm Laxman mentioned
(02/16 23:12:50) Cycreim: Oh right that thing
(02/16 23:13:08) Professor Askew: Oh, yes.
(02/16 23:13:20) Nick White: No the salary thing.
(02/16 23:13:30) Cycreim: Someone got a KI-mail that was purportedly sent to you asking about your salary
(02/16 23:13:32) Tayrtahn: oh yes
(02/16 23:13:36) Professor Askew: Salary?
(02/16 23:13:45) Nick White: Yeah someone sent me a KI mail asking me my salary?
(02/16 23:13:51) Professor Askew: Oh, that's right.
(02/16 23:13:53) Nick White: Is that the rumor?
(02/16 23:13:55) Lord Chaos: No celery here, but I do see ferns.
(02/16 23:14:03) CuzinJohn: Hey gang!
(02/16 23:14:08) Tayrtahn: from what I read, YOU sent you a KI-mail asking that
(02/16 23:14:10) Lord Chaos: Hi, Cuzin.
(02/16 23:14:16) Nick White: Thanks Lord Chaos - I hope you're peforming all weekend.
(02/16 23:14:22) Kestr'l: shorah all
(02/16 23:14:25) juk: hello
(02/16 23:14:25) Tayrtahn: but that's probably a KI-glitch
(02/16 23:14:26) Lord Chaos starts to laugh
(02/16 23:14:35) Cycreim: Yeah nobody knows who really sent it so we're just filling in the blanks
(02/16 23:14:38) Lord Chaos: If I get paid... <G>
(02/16 23:14:55) Professor Askew: Very strange.....
(02/16 23:14:55) Cycreim: Hey Cuz!
(02/16 23:15:10) Nick White: Klarren, whoever that is.
(02/16 23:15:21) Professor Askew: That's who sent it?
(02/16 23:15:21) Cycreim: Klarren sent it to you?
(02/16 23:15:28) CuzinJohn: So... what brings us together this fine evening?
(02/16 23:15:41) Cycreim: That's weird because apparently Klarren's the dude that recieved it from you
(02/16 23:15:46) Lord Chaos: Probably the fact that this is one of the few access points to Eder Delin...
(02/16 23:15:46) Professor Askew: ??
(02/16 23:16:02) Kestr'l: btw, nick, thanks for the Delin book in our neighborhood.
(02/16 23:16:11) Nick White: You bet.
(02/16 23:16:31) Cycreim: Hey Jean!
(02/16 23:16:32) Tayrtahn: Nick, care to comment on the origins of this odd KI-mail?
(02/16 23:16:38) CuzinJohn: Yeah... def bringing a little more foot traffic around
(02/16 23:16:40) Kestr'l: oh, and it's an honor to meet you!
(02/16 23:16:46) Cycreim: LOL oh god everyone wants to know now :P
(02/16 23:16:46) Professor Askew: Any thoughts, Nick?
(02/16 23:16:50) Nick White: I said what I know.
(02/16 23:16:58) Professor Askew: Gotcha.
(02/16 23:17:00) CuzinJohn: heya MJ!
(02/16 23:17:15) Nick White: I assume it has someting to do with a conversation in the anti-DRC movement hood.
(02/16 23:17:26) Cycreim: Oh god
(02/16 23:17:28) Arthur Kalnins: Hmm...
(02/16 23:17:32) Moiety Jean: Hi everyone.
(02/16 23:17:37) Thend waves hello
(02/16 23:17:41) Nick White: I told Sydney, I believe, she'd have to have some money to replace the DRC.
(02/16 23:17:43) Professor Askew: Hi, MJ!
(02/16 23:17:45) Nick White: One of thsoe deals.
(02/16 23:17:46) William: Hiya! I was hoping people were doing the puzzle. Heh.
(02/16 23:17:54) Professor Askew: Makes sense.
(02/16 23:17:59) Cycreim: Oh... right. I think they disbanded though.
(02/16 23:18:04) Nick White: Too bad.
(02/16 23:18:09) Nick White: I was looking forward to a raise.
(02/16 23:18:10) Professor Askew: Why so?
(02/16 23:18:14) Professor Askew: LOL
(02/16 23:18:15) Cycreim: LOL
(02/16 23:18:16) Professor Askew laughs
(02/16 23:18:25) Kal: DRC members...get PAID?
(02/16 23:18:29) Arthur Kalnins: So what was this all about?
(02/16 23:18:30) Kestr'l: Nick, you do the translation, right?
(02/16 23:18:31) Kal wants to join the DRC!
(02/16 23:18:38) Nick White: Right.
(02/16 23:18:39) Professor Askew: They have to eat!
(02/16 23:18:42) Arthur Kalnins: I am extremely confused.
(02/16 23:18:46) Nick White: You think I do this for fun?
(02/16 23:18:51) Thend wants to get paid too
(02/16 23:18:54) Nick White laughs at his own joke.
(02/16 23:18:55) Cycreim: Partly? :)
(02/16 23:18:59) Kestr'l: Have you heard from Sharper? He spoke highly of you in his journals
(02/16 23:19:04) Arthur Kalnins gasps "They EAT?! HEADLINE OF THE YEAR!"
(02/16 23:19:04) Nick White: Yes.
(02/16 23:19:14) Moiety Jean: I hope you like your job at least a little. ;)
(02/16 23:19:18) CuzinJohn: hey... about the translations... I gotta know... what method have you used to determine the translations?
(02/16 23:19:25) Nick White: Of course.
(02/16 23:19:25) Arthur Kalnins: What news from Sharper?
(02/16 23:19:27) Thend: What kind of translator are you, Nick? Asking money for your services - sheesh
(02/16 23:19:48) Nick White: It's just a matter of time until he's back here.
(02/16 23:19:58) CuzinJohn cheers
(02/16 23:20:05) Arthur Kalnins: Did he have any plans as to how long?
(02/16 23:20:10) Kal: I'm rather sick of waiting for things ot happen, to be honest
(02/16 23:20:10) Kestr'l: Will we get some cool jackets this time too?
(02/16 23:20:22) Moiety Jean says DOH!
(02/16 23:20:29) Kal: has he mentioned any plans, other than visiting?
(02/16 23:20:29) Thend wants a shirt with 'UBER' on it
(02/16 23:20:37) Cycreim: Does he have a KI yet? :)
(02/16 23:20:37) Nick White: Don't know if things will be the same.
(02/16 23:20:46) Nick White: May be a little different than before.
(02/16 23:20:52) Kal: I would think...
(02/16 23:20:52) Nick White: It's a different time.
(02/16 23:20:54) Kal says DOH!
(02/16 23:20:59) Cycreim: Well things are pretty different all around.
(02/16 23:21:00) Professor Askew: I agree.
(02/16 23:21:00) Kestr'l: Do you think he will work on his pet rpoject, the pub?
(02/16 23:21:04) Cycreim: It's probably a good thing.
(02/16 23:21:10) Professor Askew: Yes, Cyc.
(02/16 23:21:15) Professor Askew: Change is good.
(02/16 23:21:18) Arthur Kalnins: He was taken off that. Unless he's been re-instated.
(02/16 23:21:19) Nick White: The Watcher's Pub is already coming along...
(02/16 23:21:22) Nick White: I've been in there.
(02/16 23:21:26) Nick White: Fairly recently.
(02/16 23:21:28) Professor Askew: Nice.
(02/16 23:21:29) Thend: Nice
(02/16 23:21:31) Tayrtahn: oh really?
(02/16 23:21:32) CuzinJohn: A pub would be good... i need a drink... especially after this week...
(02/16 23:21:38) Kal starts to laugh
(02/16 23:21:43) William: Definitely looking forward to that.
(02/16 23:21:44) Moiety Jean: It'll be cool to see that.
(02/16 23:21:46) Nick White: It won't be a pub like Sharper would have done though.
(02/16 23:21:47) Cycreim: Oh man I was reading about that... :P
(02/16 23:21:51) Nick White: But maybe he can find another.
(02/16 23:21:58) Kestr'l: The water's pub is different from the Kahlo pub, right? Any plans to restore the pub by the docks?
(02/16 23:22:03) Arthur Kalnins: Yes... this one will have books...
(02/16 23:22:09) Kal: you seem to be implying he'll be working again.
(02/16 23:22:10) Moiety Jean: In a city this big, there ought to be a few. ;)
(02/16 23:22:28) Nick White: Not sure.
(02/16 23:22:33) Nick White: If he'll be working.
(02/16 23:22:34) Professor Askew: Cate knows.
(02/16 23:22:44) Cycreim: Maybe we can put in a good word for him... :)
(02/16 23:22:52) Nick White: I think Cate likes the guy.
(02/16 23:22:55) Kal: if he IS working again, how does the Council feel about it?
(02/16 23:22:55) CuzinJohn: Character references... LOL
(02/16 23:22:57) Professor Askew: Hmp.
(02/16 23:23:00) Cycreim: Douglas Sharper: hard working, VERY trustworthy :)
(02/16 23:23:02) Moiety Jean: They both like to get things done.
(02/16 23:23:12) Thend: I think Sharper and Cate will get along famously
(02/16 23:23:17) Kestr'l: I could see that
(02/16 23:23:18) Lord Chaos: Yes, MJ... but whose agenda?
(02/16 23:23:25) Kal: their agendas seem to line up, I would think
(02/16 23:23:26) CoyoteCreed: Not if Cate's a Colts fan.
(02/16 23:23:30) Moiety Jean: :)
(02/16 23:23:32) Nick White: True.
(02/16 23:23:33) Professor Askew: My thoughts, LC.
(02/16 23:23:34) Cycreim: lol
(02/16 23:23:37) Thend: Good question Askew ;)
(02/16 23:23:39) Nick White: Good point.
(02/16 23:23:47) Thend: I mean LC lol
(02/16 23:23:48) Nick White: I haven't asked Cate who her favorite team is...
(02/16 23:23:52) Kestr'l: What sign is Sharper and Cate? I wonder fi they'll but heads or get along...
(02/16 23:24:17) Cycreim: Somhow it's hard to believe that they'd get along... maybe I just don't know Sharper.
(02/16 23:24:17) Professor Askew: We'll see....
(02/16 23:24:27) Nick White: We'll see is right...
(02/16 23:24:28) Arthur Kalnins: Why does Cate like Sharper? She wants things done safely, I thought.
(02/16 23:24:34) Lord Chaos: Sharper gets along fine with those who see things his way.
(02/16 23:24:35) Thend: Sharper will find a way to get what he wants doen
(02/16 23:24:35) Kal: we have no way of knowing for sure, but I'm guessing she's not going to mind him all thatmuch if she's willing to let him down here again. Sharper's opinion of Cate, however, is entirely unpredictable.
(02/16 23:24:36) Moiety Jean: How'd you first meet up with the DRC, Nick?
(02/16 23:24:50) Nick White: Through my sister-in-law.
(02/16 23:25:00) Nick White: She worked at the same firm as Engberg.
(02/16 23:25:04) Kal: who's your brother?
(02/16 23:25:13) Thend: Which firm is that?
(02/16 23:25:13) Nick White: Not my real brother.
(02/16 23:25:31) Nick White: Wow, look at you guys given the journalistic approach here.
(02/16 23:25:37) CoyoteCreed: Your wife's brother?
(02/16 23:25:41) Professor Askew: hehe
(02/16 23:25:48) Moiety Jean: :D I was just curious.
(02/16 23:25:49) Kal: what are your thoughts on recent Saudi oil price hikes?
(02/16 23:25:52) CoyoteCreed: Or...wat..Wife's sister
(02/16 23:25:57) Moiety Jean starts to laugh
(02/16 23:25:58) Cycreim: Have you been through the door yet, Nick? Looks like we've got enough to open it easily
(02/16 23:25:59) Nick White: Dude I'm not married.
(02/16 23:25:59) Kal: how do you feel about Bush's administration?
(02/16 23:26:04) Tayrtahn: So, Delin still seems fairly clear... is the storm far off?
(02/16 23:26:05) Thend: Well, we do like puzzle-solving ;)
(02/16 23:26:05) Professor Askew: Sheesh.
(02/16 23:26:09) Kestr'l: Hey Nick, on a lighter note - Heroes, Lost, or both?
(02/16 23:26:12) Nick White: And if you see any single ladies, let them know I'm here.
(02/16 23:26:21) CuzinJohn: Lol
(02/16 23:26:25) Arthur Kalnins: I need some clarification on an issue, Nick. When will the DRC publish or post a paper on the cavern roof stability?
(02/16 23:26:26) Cycreim says okay
(02/16 23:26:28) Kal: you're looking at a few right now...
(02/16 23:26:29) Thend: Is Cate single, Nick?
(02/16 23:26:37) Arthur Kalnins says DOH!
(02/16 23:26:39) Moiety Jean: Oh lord
(02/16 23:26:45) Kal: yeah, is Hillary Cli- I mean, Cate single?
(02/16 23:27:00) Thend: I wasn;'t asking for myself, Art, Nick's the one looking lol
(02/16 23:27:01) CuzinJohn: Oh no you didn't go there...
(02/16 23:27:13) Kal: why do I go there? Why?
(02/16 23:27:16) Moiety Jean looks around for a bit
(02/16 23:27:17) Nick White: I can't even comment on that.
(02/16 23:27:18) Cycreim: Why do I have this image of Cate opening the door and saying "Have a great date!"
(02/16 23:27:23) Nick White: A bit old for my taste.
(02/16 23:27:25) Kal: LOL
(02/16 23:27:25) Thend starts to laugh
(02/16 23:27:27) Moiety Jean: haha, Cyc
(02/16 23:27:32) Arthur Kalnins: Anyhow.
(02/16 23:27:37) Kestr'l chuckles
(02/16 23:27:47) Arthur Kalnins: Roof stability report? Is it coming out? If so, any times?
(02/16 23:27:51) Cycreim: Seriously though. We have more than enough to open the door.
(02/16 23:28:01) Kal: Arthur, a dead horse, my friend.
(02/16 23:28:06) Lord Chaos: Nick, are you still working on translating D'ni documents?
(02/16 23:28:06) Tayrtahn: Delin's weather seems fairly normal... think we might see a storm soon or is it a ways off?
(02/16 23:28:07) Kal: Dead horse...
(02/16 23:28:10) Arthur Kalnins: Dead horse, but it stinks.
(02/16 23:28:23) Cycreim: Laxman didn't say anything about a storm but
(02/16 23:28:24) CoyoteCreed: Yeah, but it will be hard to coordinate a door attempt with such intense conversation.
(02/16 23:28:27) Kal: they tend to. picking at them doesn't make it better.
(02/16 23:28:31) Thend: Nick, what was the most surprising thing you ever found when translated?
(02/16 23:28:33) Arthur Kalnins: I want it cleaned up properly so it stops stinking
(02/16 23:28:43) William: I agree Coyote, that's why i didn't try to organize people to do it. hehe.
(02/16 23:28:44) Nick White: That's a tough question.
(02/16 23:28:51) Nick White: Probably the coolest stuff is with the Unseen.
(02/16 23:28:59) Nick White: Pretty sweet.
(02/16 23:29:00) CuzinJohn nods his head
(02/16 23:29:03) Nick White: Well guys, I gotta run.
(02/16 23:29:05) Kestr'l: You mean what we tuen into when we enter the Library ?
(02/16 23:29:07) Cycreim: Oh yeah!
(02/16 23:29:07) Nick White: Been good talking.
(02/16 23:29:08) Kal: seeya
(02/16 23:29:08) Kestr'l: :)
(02/16 23:29:16) William: Ah, safe travels!
(02/16 23:29:17) Tayrtahn: nice to talk to you
(02/16 23:29:18) Thend: Seeya Nick
(02/16 23:29:20) Moiety Jean: Wonder if that refers to the Bahro at all
(02/16 23:29:20) Arthur Kalnins: Please get the roof stability report out soon, Nick.
(02/16 23:29:20) Cycreim: Sorry about the crazy rumour stuff, Nick
(02/16 23:29:21) CoyoteCreed: Gotta run? Hit Caps Lock. Works for me.
(02/16 23:29:21) CuzinJohn: Thanks for visiting!
(02/16 23:29:21) Tayrtahn salutes
(02/16 23:29:30) Professor Askew: Bye, Nick.
(02/16 23:29:30) Moiety Jean: ah well, see you again Nick.
(02/16 23:29:32) Kal bows
(02/16 23:29:33) Nick White: Uh, don't hold your breath for a roof report.
(02/16 23:29:37) Nick White: It's not a big deal.
(02/16 23:29:37) Cycreim: This was cool. Especially after Laxman. He's all business. :)
(02/16 23:29:40) Kal: THANK YOU
(02/16 23:29:44) Nick White: Hello Heaven.
(Heaven being a female explorer standing near Nick)
(02/16 23:29:45) Kal: THANK YOU GOD
(02/16 23:29:46) Lord Chaos: Ghaelen does a good Roof Report!
(02/16 23:29:48) Arthur Kalnins: Okay. That's enough to know.
(02/16 23:29:52) Tayrtahn starts to laugh
(02/16 23:29:53) Kestr'l: thanks, hope to see you again!
(02/16 23:29:55) Arthur Kalnins: If it's not a big deal, good.
(02/16 23:29:57) Thend: lol LC
(02/16 23:29:58) Nick White: You single?
(02/16 23:30:04) Kal: geeze...
(02/16 23:30:04) Thend starts to laugh
(02/16 23:30:12) Kal: take it easy, Stallion.
(02/16 23:30:17) Arthur Kalnins rubs his temples
(02/16 23:30:20) Tayrtahn looks the other way
(02/16 23:30:20) Thend: taking down eachother's numbers lol
(02/16 23:30:22) Nick White: Just kidding folks.
(02/16 23:30:28) Kal snots
(02/16 23:30:29) Kal: agh
(02/16 23:30:33) Arthur Kalnins: Ew
(02/16 23:30:35) Nick White: Settle down. Settle down.
(02/16 23:30:35) Kal: i hate my slow keyboard
(02/16 23:30:41) CuzinJohn: Suuuure you are... wink wink nudge nudge...
(02/16 23:30:46) Moiety Jean grins
(02/16 23:30:48) Kal hates typos with a passion
(02/16 23:30:52) Cycreim flinches
(02/16 23:30:57) Thend typos with a passion
(02/16 23:31:00) Nick White: I don't think she heard me.
(02/16 23:31:01) CoyoteCreed: The Cavern really needs a tabloid to jump on stories like this one.
(02/16 23:31:03) Kestr'l: hey come back for a party sometime
(02/16 23:31:08) Lord Chaos thinks we all learn to speak typo down here...
(02/16 23:31:10) Nick White: You know it.
(02/16 23:31:12) Thend: Palying coy maybe
(02/16 23:31:17) Nick White: I suppose.
(02/16 23:31:20) Arthur Kalnins: Since you're still here, do you have a more firm date on when Sharper's coming?
(02/16 23:31:26) Kal: NICK WHITE ENGAGES IN PASSIONATE AFFAIR WITH UNNAMED EXPLORER
(02/16 23:31:32) Nick White: Who wouldn't want the chance to date a DRC translator?
(02/16 23:31:32) Thend starts to laugh
(02/16 23:31:39) Arthur Kalnins: I don't.
(02/16 23:31:40) Professor Askew sighs
(02/16 23:31:42) Nick White: I can recite ancient D'ni prophecies to her.
(02/16 23:31:43) Cycreim: Sharper doesn't believe in firm dates!
