(01/30 17:36:43) Michael Engberg: I know. Everyone wants everything right now.
(01/30 17:36:50) Whilyam: Michael, can I ask you something?
(01/30 17:37:10) Michael Engberg: Sure.
(01/30 17:37:23) Whilyam: I've heard Sharper is returning, any idea as to what if anything he'll be doing here withthe DRC?
(01/30 17:38:03) Michael Engberg: No idea.
(01/30 17:38:25) Michael Engberg: I'll be surprised if he really does come down.
(01/30 17:38:32) Michael Engberg: It's really only rumor right now.
(01/30 17:38:57) Whilyam: Oh?
(01/30 17:39:12) Whilyam: One of your Res Engs didn't think it was.
(01/30 17:39:41) Whilyam needs a moment to breathe!
(01/30 17:40:26) Whilyam: Michael, my heart isn't what it should be, are we going to keep puffing around the City? Is this some new DRC fitness program?
(01/30 17:40:40) Whilyam needs a moment to breathe!
(01/30 17:44:39) Michael Engberg: Well, that's disappointing.
(01/30 17:44:4 Whilyam: Disappointing?
(01/30 17:45:07) Matthew Allen: what is disappointing?
(01/30 17:45:25) Michael Engberg: The fact this is open.
(01/30 17:45:35) Michael Engberg: Typical.
(01/30 17:45:41) Michael Engberg: Rush everything.
(01/30 17:46:07) Michael Engberg: Everyone is in a mad rush to open as much as possible as fast as possible and I'm not.
(01/30 17:47:30) Thend: Has there been much in-fighting with the DRC lately?
(01/30 17:47:44) Michael Engberg: Disagreement.
(01/30 17:47:55) Monkeyboy: There's a rumour Sharper is coming back
(01/30 17:48:01) Michael Engberg: Yes, there is.
(01/30 17:48:09) Professor Askew: There always disagreements in a group.
(01/30 17:48:12) Professor Askew: hehe
(01/30 17:48:14) Michael Engberg: Of course.
(01/30 17:48:29) Michael Engberg: I just hope our rushes never come back to bite us.
(01/30 17:48:36) Monkeyboy: How do you feel about Sharper?
(01/30 17:48:41) Michael Engberg: He's fine.
(01/30 17:48:49) Michael Engberg: I'd rather worry about more important things.
(01/30 17:48:59) Hu K'hanDhat: such as?
(01/30 17:49:0 Michael Engberg: Ages... city areas... work.
(01/30 17:50:16) Hu K'hanDhat: So if i understand you right, we should be carefull in newly opened areas?
(01/30 17:50:19) Michael Engberg: There are different definitions of ready.
(01/30 17:50:34) Michael Engberg: No, I don't mean to scare anyone.
(01/30 17:50:53) Michael Engberg: Just my own thoughts.
(01/30 17:51:02) Michael Engberg: I prefer the slower release.
(01/30 17:51:11) Michael Engberg: But most of the time the others don't agree.
(01/30 17:54:41) Whilyam: Michael, we heard about a new age, mostly water, about a week ago. It was supposedly on track for restoration but was stopped. Could you provide some more info on this?
(01/30 17:54:52) Prometheus: Anything else the rest of the DRC is pushing for that you are against, Mr. Engberg?
(01/30 17:55:17) Michael Engberg: Yes.
(01/30 17:55:43) Michael Engberg: Although it seems we're delaying the next Age, which is good.
(01/30 17:55:5 Whilyam: Tsogahl?
(01/30 17:56:06) Michael Engberg: Yes.
(01/30 17:56:10) Hu K'hanDhat: Safety measures i guess?
(01/30 17:56:11) Michael Engberg: Most likely.
(01/30 17:56:16) Michael Engberg: Yes.
(01/30 17:56:34) Michael Engberg: Confirming what we think we know.
(01/30 17:56:40) Monkeyboy: What is making it delayed?
(01/30 17:56:57) vid: Can you give us any details about the "weather issues" that were holding back Eder Delin?
(01/30 17:56:59) Michael Engberg: Nothing.
(01/30 17:57:06) Michael Engberg: I do need to get going.
(01/30 17:57:12) Michael Engberg: Enjoy the bridge.
