(01/25 23:21:15) Nick White: Not really.
(01/25 23:21:27) imara: stay away from the barrier, its sticky
(01/25 23:21:47) rilrov: Yeah half way through a leap of faith
(01/25 23:21:47) imara: oh well
(01/25 23:21:49) imara: i'm not into those
(01/25 23:22:18) rilrov: Well a bridge would be nice

(01/25 23:24:44) imara: stuck on the barrier?
(01/25 23:24:57) Nick White: hate when I get stuck on a barrier
(01/25 23:24:57) imara: thats a bad one, you only have to be near it
(01/25 23:25:19) Marck: Does anyone know details about the pulsing light down at the ferry docks?
(01/25 23:25:32) Njim: the server is going to chrash there are so many people here
(01/25 23:25:48) Nick White: server?
(01/25 23:25:57) mark1221: what pulsing lights?
(01/25 23:26:13) imara: how did you get off the barrier?
(01/25 23:26:23) Marck: One light. In the water by the docks
(01/25 23:26:55) Nick White: Walked.
(01/25 23:26:55) mark1221: which dock i havnt seen it
(01/25 23:26:56) imara: i've always had to relto out
(01/25 23:27:08) imara: nice trick
(01/25 23:27:14) Leonor says hey
(01/25 23:27:25) imara: hello Leonor
(01/25 23:27:54) Leonor: Hi imara
(01/25 23:27:54) Marck: I am talking about the docks next to the ferry terminal, where some sunken ships are
(01/25 23:28:24) Njim: yeah thats a pretty interesting light
(01/25 23:28:29) Theo waves hello
(01/25 23:29:53) mark1221: i dont seeeee it
(01/25 23:29:54) Nick White: DRC was investigating bringing up a boat - lights are related
(01/25 23:29:57) Leonor: Ah, that would be cool.
(01/25 23:30:09) imara: that would be
(01/25 23:30:18) Lex Mark: Hey Leonor it's me Benson
(01/25 23:30:28) Marck: Any info about when the DRC will actually do this investigation of the light?
(01/25 23:31:10) Nick White: If the light is the one I think it is, the DRC is causing the light.
(01/25 23:31:14) Eleri: I miss the Library
(01/25 23:31:45) Nick White: Shouldn't be too long
(01/25 23:31:47) Deledrius: i miss the library music
(01/25 23:32:01) Nick White: Although, you never know lately.
(01/25 23:32:05) NSymon: me to Eleri
(01/25 23:32:05) imara: so you think they will be able to get the boat up?
(01/25 23:32:08) Nick White: Not sure anyone is trying real hard right now.
(01/25 23:32:25) Leonor: Any new kings' books coming?
(01/25 23:32:26) imara: okay
(01/25 23:32:51) Nick White: They'll all done.
(01/25 23:32:52) Nick White: Not sure when they will all be in the palace.
(01/25 23:32:58) Marck: Huh? In what way is the DRCcausing it? The light is under water
(01/25 23:33:12) Nick White: Yeah, they've had divers down there before.
(01/25 23:33:14) Eleri: dive equipment
(01/25 23:33:16) Amrak: Shorah!
(01/25 23:33:20) Nick White: along with underwater lights.
(01/25 23:33:26) Marck: Oh, I see
(01/25 23:33:45) Marck: But they are spending very much time there then. The light is there for weeks
(01/25 23:33:54) imara: how do you like Eder Delin?
(01/25 23:34:07) Nick White: Probably left it there or something.
(01/25 23:34:15) Nick White: Delin is cool.
(01/25 23:34:32) Marck: Do you know anything about the results of the DRC's investigation?
(01/25 23:34:47) Nick White: which one?
(01/25 23:35:35) Marck: I am still talking about the light :)
(01/25 23:35:38) Geert (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(01/25 23:35:47) Nick White: Ah... no idea.
(01/25 23:35:55) Nick White: I don't think anyone is working real hard on it though.
(01/25 23:36:10) Amrak: So what was updated?
(01/25 23:36:22) Marck: I guess there are more pressing issues, right?
(01/25 23:36:27) Nick White: right.
(01/25 23:36:51) Leonor: Like, for instance...
(01/25 23:37:11) Nick White: right now, trying to work out their big argument about releasing ages.
(01/25 23:37:23) Nick White: then other ages...
(01/25 23:37:28) Nick White: city locations...
(01/25 23:37:31) imara: they are arguing about the ages?
(01/25 23:37:35) Nick White: Yeah.
(01/25 23:37:43) Amrak: when you've done everthing, you can rail jump
(01/25 23:37:44) Marck: Argument? Some want to release Ages and others do not?
(01/25 23:37:53) Nick White: Pretty much.
(01/25 23:37:59) Nick White: Two vs. two.
(01/25 23:38:21) Nick White: Not like there is an official vote but they usually discuss it - this is the first to be a problem.
(01/25 23:38:21) Marck: I think I can guess who those twos are ;)
(01/25 23:38:27) Nick White: I'm not sure.
(01/25 23:38:54) Nick White: Regardless, it's overboard if you ask me.
(01/25 23:39:00) Amrak: yes
(01/25 23:39:03) Nick White: The Age is pretty much done.
(01/25 23:39:07) Nick White: Ready to go.
(01/25 23:39:15) Leonor: Which age?
(01/25 23:39:17) Nick White: But you aren't seeing it.
(01/25 23:39:27) Nick White: Tsoghal.
(01/25 22:41:46) Marck: Are they afraid of security issues or the weather? ;)
(01/25 22:42:02) Nick White: I think they just want to make sure "nothing happens"
(01/25 22:42:17) Nick White: I don't know all the details...
(01/25 22:42:21) Leonor: We're not seeing Tsoghal soon or ever?
(01/25 22:42:23) Marck: But we are very interested in "something happening" :)
(01/25 22:42:59) pappou: Isnt Tsoghal the new age coming out the 15th
(01/25 22:42:59) Nick White: Soon... it'll come eventually.
(01/25 22:43:10) Nick White: 15th?
(01/25 22:43:13) pappou: but not this next one?
(01/25 22:43:14) Nick White: Don't know about that...
(01/25 22:43:16) Marck: Is Cate a factor in this argument, too?
(01/25 22:43:22) pappou: yes, GD said the 15th of feb
(01/25 22:43:24) Leonor: Ah. Are they worried because of the cloths?
(01/25 22:43:28) Amrak: I can help in Kadish
(01/25 22:43:46) Nick White: Like I said I don't know details. I think Cate is trying ot figure out a solution and/or compromise.
(01/25 22:43:50) Nick White: Who knows...
(01/25 22:43:59) Arthur Kalnins: A solution? To what?
(01/25 22:44:05) Nick White: If it's the 15th... you know something I don't...
(01/25 22:44:12) Nick White: To the impasse.
(01/25 22:44:20) Arthur Kalnins: Of Delin's cloths?
(01/25 22:44:32) Nick White: Hey, heard from Sharper again... to move to better news.
(01/25 22:44:34) Marck: On the 15th more explorers will start to support the funding of the restoration
(01/25 22:44:38) Arthur Kalnins: Oh?
(01/25 22:44:38) NSymon: oh?
(01/25 22:44:48) NSymon: how is he?
(01/25 22:44:48) Nick White: Pats are done and I wouldn't be surprised to see him down here the way he was talking.
(01/25 22:44:51) pappou: GD put it on the forums at about 1:00 todya
(01/25 22:45:03) Leonor: Really?
(01/25 22:45:04) Arthur Kalnins: What is he going to be doing?
(01/25 22:45:09) Arthur Kalnins: Teledahn still?
(01/25 22:45:24) Arthur Kalnins: Or is he taking a shot at stealing more books from pubs?
(01/25 22:45:25) pappou: he didnt say which age though
(01/25 22:45:30) Nick White: Not sure... just seemed surprised that so much was happening again...
(01/25 22:45:39) Nick White: Sounded interested.
(01/25 22:45:53) Theo: Is he returning to the cavern too?
(01/25 22:45:58) Tiran says hey
(01/25 22:45:59) Nick White: I told him I won't be surprised when he shows up and he said not to count on it but I could tell he's coming.
(01/25 22:46:16) NSymon: interesting to hear
(01/25 22:46:18) S'am: any idea what he's been up to all this time?
(01/25 22:46:24) Marck: Will the DRC be willing to give Sharper a task again?
(01/25 22:46:32) Nick White: Who knows...
(01/25 22:46:35) Arthur Kalnins: Yes, what's gone on with him and Cate.
(01/25 22:46:37) Nick White: On both questions.
(01/25 22:46:44) Old Man: bartender
(01/25 22:46:48) S'am laughs
(01/25 22:46:49) Leonor: Sounds to me he wants to come undercover...
(01/25 22:46:50) Jimbo: hi eleri
(01/25 22:46:50) Arthur Kalnins: Cate doesn't seem one to deal with troublemakers like Sharper.
(01/25 22:46:54) Nick White: He's talked to her.
(01/25 22:46:56) Eleri: hey Jimbo!
(01/25 22:47:02) Leonor: Shaper talked to Cate?
(01/25 22:47:07) Nick White: Yeah last week.
(01/25 22:47:12) Arthur Kalnins nods his head
(01/25 22:47:13) NSymon: I think Cate and Sharper would be quite an interesting mix
(01/25 22:47:40) S'am thinks they're secret lovers
(01/25 22:47:40) Nick White: I think Sharper wants to make sure if he comes down he's not coming into a hornet's nest.
(01/25 22:47:47) Nick White: Ha!
(01/25 22:47:50) Tiran: an explosive mix
(01/25 22:47:57) Nick White: Cate's not his style.
(01/25 22:48:07) Arthur Kalnins: So what's her opinion of him?
(01/25 22:48:09) S'am: no, I wouldn't think so
(01/25 22:48:18) Nick White: Haven't talked to her about that.
(01/25 22:48:19) Nick White: Not sure.
(01/25 22:48:38) S'am: what's her opinion of any of the DRC for that matter?
(01/25 22:48:45) Nick White: Not sure.
(01/25 22:48:47) S'am: aside from "too slow"
(01/25 22:48:56) Arthur Kalnins: What's her opinion of YOU? :P
(01/25 22:49:05) Nick White: Not sure.
(01/25 22:49:11) Arthur Kalnins starts to laugh
(01/25 22:49:15) S'am: who do you generally work with Nick?
(01/25 22:49:17) Nick White: Don't plan on asking any time soon either
(01/25 22:49:21) Nick White: Varies.
(01/25 22:49:27) Nick White: Kodama lately.
(01/25 22:49:42) S'am: I suppse you can't reveal what projects you work on?
(01/25 22:49:44) Arthur Kalnins: Careful, Nick, "not sure" to you is becoming like "no" is to Kodama
(01/25 22:50:08) Leonor: I'm too shy, you ask
(01/25 22:50:10) Leonor: Oops
(01/25 22:50:12) Eleri: everyone needs an enigmatic phrase
(01/25 22:50:14) NSymon: haha
(01/25 22:50:18) Theo: Any particuler age?
(01/25 22:50:26) Nick White: I'm not that bad.
(01/25 22:50:39) Nick White: Yeah I've been to Er'Cana and some others...
(01/25 22:50:48) Arthur Kalnins: Yes, what has the DRC been working on?
(01/25 22:50:54) Marck: How does SHarper feel about Phil's accident now?
(01/25 22:50:56) Ni 'Cahlas the Young: what others=
(01/25 22:51:01) Arthur Kalnins: What about this "Katha Island" I heard about?
(01/25 22:51:14) Nick White: Katha...
(01/25 22:51:24) Arthur Kalnins: Mansion on the lake
(01/25 22:51:25) Nick White: Is that the Guild of Illusions?
(01/25 22:51:27) Arthur Kalnins: Yes
(01/25 22:51:28) Nick White: Yeah...
(01/25 22:51:30) Theo: Yep
(01/25 22:51:36) Arthur Kalnins: Built by the Guildmaster as his mansion
(01/25 22:51:45) Nick White: Real early....cool spot though just because of the history.
(01/25 22:51:50) Arthur Kalnins: Any news on restoration of that?
(01/25 22:51:54) Nick White: Haven't been there in a long time.
(01/25 22:52:12) S'am: any idea when the DRC website will start getting regular updates (or broken links fixed)?
(01/25 22:52:33) Amrak: You can most likely decipher most of the D'n1 alphabet with the books in the Hall of Kings!
(01/25 22:53:07) mark1221: Why are wel all standing up heree
(01/25 22:53:19) Nick White: Soon for the site.
(01/25 22:53:24) Arthur Kalnins: Soon?
(01/25 22:53:31) Theo: nice
(01/25 22:53:36) Arthur Kalnins: Anything on the real world calendar
(01/25 22:54:02) S'am: I will really feel like the DRC are back for good when the website is running again.
(01/25 22:54:03) Nick White: What do you mean by that?
(01/25 22:54:10) Nick White: Yeah, that'll be good.
(01/25 22:54:17) Arthur Kalnins: As in actual time :P
(01/25 22:54:21) Arthur Kalnins: Like a week, two weeks
(01/25 22:54:27) Arthur Kalnins: a month
(01/25 22:54:29) NSymon: any news on the library and museum Nick?
(01/25 22:54:29) Arthur Kalnins: a year
(01/25 22:54:37) S'am: as soon as Laxman learns html
(01/25 22:54:49) Theo: Lol
(01/25 22:54:52) Matthew Allen: hi Nick, I just got here when I heard you were around.. so are we likely to see any progress around here with this city or whatnot this week? It's been pretty dead around here since Delin was released
(01/25 22:55:07) Nick White: Yeah, I explained why earlier.
(01/25 22:55:16) Nick White: Should be some small stuff...
(01/25 22:55:21) Nick White: Maybe the library path...
(01/25 22:55:31) S'am: ooo, that's pretty good
(01/25 22:55:42) Tiran: with or without the lib?
(01/25 22:55:47) Matthew Allen: does the DRC know anything about the journey door or cloths in Delin? Who put them there or why?
(01/25 22:55:52) Nick White: without
(01/25 22:55:56) Nick White: The Bahro.
(01/25 22:56:04) Nick White: And all that crazy Yeesha stuff...
(01/25 22:56:07) S'am: how about getting a bridge across this gap? Seems rather unsafe right now, by DRC standards
(01/25 22:56:21) Nick White: Next week I bet.
(01/25 22:56:25) S'am: cool
(01/25 22:56:33) Leonor: Yeesha didn't leave a message this time.
(01/25 22:56:38) Eleri wins a bet about Delin
(01/25 22:56:40) imara: The Bahro put the Delin cloths there?
(01/25 22:56:45) imara: hmm
(01/25 22:57:00) Nick White: The DRC can't make cloths that do all that stuff... just so you kow.
(01/25 22:57:04) Nick White: know.
(01/25 22:57:15) imara: okay
(01/25 22:57:15) S'am: I believe I read a post on the forums that said the correct term is "yeesha bahro voodoo magic"
(01/25 22:57:21) Eleri: has there been more Bahro activity?
(01/25 22:57:22) Leonor starts to laugh
(01/25 22:57:23) Nick White: Yeah, that works.
(01/25 22:57:24) Marck: Has there been any direct contact between the DRC and Yeesah or the Bahro?
(01/25 22:57:33) Matthew Allen: yes but does the DRC have evidence that Yeesha did it herself? She didn't leave a speech or any other evidence..
(01/25 22:57:38) Nick White: No.
(01/25 22:57:44) Nick White: For both.
(01/25 22:57:51) S'am: she left the other cloths, so it seems like a good bet until we learn more
(01/25 22:57:57) mark1221: do we know by any chance what the thing that ended up in our relto is after we complete the delin age is?
(01/25 22:58:06) Nick White: I don't.
(01/25 22:58:18) Nick White: Again, the DRC isn't doing it.
(01/25 22:58:21) Matthew Allen: Oh, has the DRC had the chance to examine the "spark" in Gahreesen?
(01/25 22:58:24) Eleri: They're certainly loud enough... I wonder when one of us is going to bump into one in a dark corner
(01/25 22:58:33) Eleri shudders
(01/25 22:58:56) Nick White: They know about it.
(01/25 22:58:58) Nick White: Again....
(01/25 22:59:03) Arthur Kalnins: When will the bridge be repaired?
(01/25 22:59:05) Tiran: But do they know what it is?
(01/25 22:59:27) Nick White: Unless something is pretty obviously not magic... well there's a good chance we don't know what it is or how it is working.
(01/25 22:59:46) Nick White: Temp bridge should be back soon.
(01/25 22:59:56) Arthur Kalnins: Should people complete the Delin journey or leave it alone?
(01/25 22:59:58) Eleri: yeah, floating sparklies that appear out of nowhere count as 'magic' for now
(01/25 23:00:07) imara: are there plans for a permanent bridge?
(01/25 23:00:09) Matthew Allen: has the DRC found anything interesting in the museum or library since they've been closed back off?
(01/25 23:00:13) S'am: it's probably hard to analyze blue sparkly things that disappear when you touch them
(01/25 23:00:17) Nick White: long term plans yeah
(01/25 23:00:26) Leonor: Cool!
(01/25 23:00:26) Nick White: Yeah...some good stuff in the Museum.
(01/25 23:00:37) Nick White: Hey, I gotta run.
(01/25 23:00:42) Matthew Allen: interesing
(01/25 23:00:43) Nick White: Just got a message.
(01/25 23:00:44) Tiran: can you elaborate on the new stuff ?
(01/25 23:00:44) Leonor: See you Nick
(01/25 23:00:46) Marck: lol. Please, do not be so specific about it :)
(01/25 23:00:47) Nick White: Talk to you all later.
(01/25 23:00:49) Arthur Kalnins: What about hte Delin Journey?
(01/25 23:00:50) S'am: thanks for coming to talk to us Nick
(01/25 23:00:50) Theo: bye Nick
(01/25 23:00:52) NSymon: thanks Nick
(01/25 23:00:57) Leonor: Thanks for the chat
(01/25 23:00:58) Theo: Thnks
(01/25 23:00:59) Matthew Allen: See you around Nick, thanks for the updates
