(01/17 17:42:25) Dr. Kodama: We make them available and she sometimes alters them.
(01/17 17:42:27) Jan Stepmeir: jumping for joy?
(01/17 17:42:45) Dr. Kodama: We don't know why or don't know how...
(01/17 17:43:04) Dr. Kodama: Sometimes I jump to relieve stress....
(01/17 17:43:19) Joel: Wait, you made a book available to somewhere in the city by... placing a book in the city? THEN Yeesha altered it? I'm confused, a bit.

(01/17 17:43:35) Kelm: Any news about the inquest over Phil Henderson
(01/17 17:43:38) Jan Stepmeir: why're you under stress?
(01/17 17:43:52) Joel scratches his head.
(01/17 17:44:13) Dr. Kodama: Yeesha altered it before we placed it.
(01/17 17:44:33) Arthur Kalnins: So this book leads now to one of her instances?
(01/17 17:44:43) Joel: Where was the original planned location for the book?
(01/17 17:44:45) Gadren: Very intriguing
(01/17 17:45:04) Dr. Kodama: Evidently.
(01/17 17:45:18) Dr. Kodama: I'm going to start.
(01/17 17:45:20) Malakh: what book is this we are refering to?
(01/17 17:45:28) Arthur Kalnins: Go right ahead, Dr.
(01/17 17:45:46) Malakh claps his hands
(01/17 17:45:48) Joel: The book to the Great Zero. It's in the book room, Malakh.
(01/17 17:45:56) Malakh: ok
(01/17 17:46:07) Dr. Kodama: For those who have not heard, the Liaisons have resigned as of about an hour ago.
(01/17 17:46:32) Malakh is sorta bummed...
(01/17 17:46:39) <sniffle> Kimmie is sad
(01/17 17:46:47) Thend understands
(01/17 17:46:51) Dr. Kodama: The DRC has accepted their resignation and done away with the position.
(01/17 17:47:35) Dr. Kodama: Perhaps things may change in the future but for the present, the Liasison position is no longer necessry.
