(02/05 20:07:11) Jeremy: It's very nice here, thank you for allowing us to return
(02/05 20:07:18) lightkeeper: Hi Cate
(02/05 20:07:23) Cate Alexander: We're glad you are all here.
(02/05 20:07:57) Cate Alexander: I've heard some complaints about the lack of forums on the new site? Does anyone here care?
(02/05 20:08:16) Toh'mas: Only in the sense that a lot of good information was archived there, I would hate to lose it
(02/05 20:08:33) Jan Stepmeir: personally I've never used them, but I did scan them every once and awhile
(02/05 20:08:35) Jeremy: It would be nice to see some of what the DRC is thinking.
(02/05 20:08:37) lightkeeper: It would be nice to be able to interact with the DRC on a forum yes
(02/05 20:08:59) J'Hain: I'm not a great fan of forums
(02/05 20:09:20) Cate Alexander: I do want to spread the word that they will not be returning. There seems to be some confusion.
(02/05 20:09:39) Jeremy: Too much upkeep?
(02/05 20:09:47) Toh'mas: noted, we'll pass the word.
(02/05 20:09:50) Cate Alexander: The DRC does have private forums but the public ones have been pulled.
(02/05 20:09:52) lightkeeper: The forums not returning you mean?
(02/05 20:09:56) Cate Alexander: Correct.
(02/05 20:10:01) Jan Stepmeir: probably want us to concentrate on the urulive.com forums
(02/05 20:10:03) lightkeeper: OK Sad
(02/05 20:10:13) Toh'mas: In fact, knowing this community, there's probably already a forum post about this ;)
(02/05 20:10:20) Cate Alexander: I'm sure.
(02/05 20:10:27) Cate Alexander: And two or three responses.
(02/05 20:10:30) Jeremy: It's unfortunate, but it's understandable I suppose
(02/05 20:10:40) Cate Alexander: Thanks for your understanding.
(02/05 20:11:01) Garymuc: I just came in, did I miss something?
(02/05 20:11:25) Cate Alexander: I do have some meetings to get off to but I did want to communicate that in person first.
(02/05 20:11:30) Jeremy: Miss Alexander has asked that we take a look at the new DRC webpage, and realize that the forums therein will not be returning.
(02/05 20:11:38) Jan Stepmeir: well thanks for the update
(02/05 20:11:41) Cate Alexander: Thank you.
(02/05 20:11:44) Garymuc: thx
(02/05 20:11:46) Cate Alexander: Have a great day.
