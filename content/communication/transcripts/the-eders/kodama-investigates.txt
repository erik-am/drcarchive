(02/21 20:29:24) To Dr. Kodama: Shorah, Doctor. May I ask you a question?
(02/21 20:31:51) To Dr. Kodama: I'll take that as a yes.. Several explorers have had concerns over the stability of the cavern ceiling. You have the doctorate in Geology, do you think the cavern roof is stable?
(02/21 21:01:55) From Dr. Kodama in sil_oh_wet's Bevin: I have no concerns.
(02/21 21:02:20) To Dr. Kodama in sil_oh_wet's Bevin: Thank you very much, Doctor.
(02/21 21:04:09) Whilyam: Inspecting the area where Yeesha was reported from yesterday?
(02/21 21:04:30) Dr. Kodama: Just looking around.
(02/21 21:06:03) Whilyam: Was there any damage caused by Yeesha's appearance yesterday?
(02/21 21:06:16) Dr. Kodama: Not that I'm aware of.
(02/21 21:09:58) Jan Stepmeir: ok ... never seen a person do that before... lol
(02/21 21:10:08) Whilyam: do what?
(02/21 21:10:40) Jan Stepmeir: instead of the short jump walk, the Dr.'s on speed
(02/21 21:11:09) Jan Stepmeir: and hiya Dr.
(02/21 21:11:10) Dr. Kodama: Sorry. Not me.
(02/21 21:11:15) Whilyam: Well I have a hard time thinking you're here for pleasure, Dr. Considering what happened here yesterday.
(02/21 21:11:34) Dr. Kodama: Just looking around.
(02/21 21:11:47) Whilyam: I noticed that.
(02/21 21:11:48) Jan Stepmeir: so no comment from the DRC on the appearance?
(02/21 21:11:56) Dr. Kodama: What would you like me to say?
(02/21 21:12:07) Whilyam: Any ideas on how this occured?
(02/21 21:12:08) Jan Stepmeir: good question
(02/21 21:12:18) Whilyam: Some people say Yeesha's hologram appeared.
(02/21 21:12:27) Dr. Kodama: Stil not exactly sure what occured.
(02/21 21:12:35) Dr. Kodama: Need to know that before we can speculate as to how.
(02/21 21:12:48) Whilyam: A hologram of Yeesha appeared on the fountain.
(02/21 21:13:04) Dr. Kodama: What people describe as a hologram...yes.
(02/21 21:14:25) Jan Stepmeir: how about a comment on the Museum doors then?
(02/21 21:14:48) Dr. Kodama: Ask Laxman... I never knew doors were that difficult to make function.
(02/21 21:15:05) Lydiamalia: The Library doors are not working right either
(02/21 21:15:06) Jan Stepmeir: lol, they do seem to have a mind of their own
(02/21 21:15:20) Dr. Kodama: We are aware of the doors that are not working.
(02/21 21:15:29) Whilyam: We would, but he's been around here like a slug in a salt shaker...
(02/21 21:15:42) Dr. Kodama: Good. He has plenty of work to keep him busy.
(02/21 21:16:10) Whilyam: Then it's unreasonable for us to ask him..
(02/21 21:16:24) Lydiamalia: Do you have a comment on Yeesha's apperance?
(02/21 21:16:33) Dr. Kodama: No.
(02/21 21:16:45) <sniffle> Lydiamalia is sad
(02/21 21:16:57) Kiyoshi thinks 'No'; *was* a comment
(02/21 21:17:22) Jan Stepmeir: does the DRC have a contingency plan in case Yeesha takes over the Restoration?
(02/21 21:17:28) Dr. Kodama: No.
(02/21 21:17:56) Whilyam: Do you suggest explorers go on the journey through Delin and Tsogahl?
(02/21 21:18:13) Lydiamalia: Do you have any news for us
(02/21 21:18:15) Dr. Kodama: Those Ages have been approved. I see no reason not to.
(02/21 21:18:31) Lydiamalia: Or advice?
(02/21 21:18:56) Dr. Kodama: Advice pertaining to what?
(02/21 21:19:06) Whilyam: How to conduct ourselves down here?
(02/21 21:19:32) Dr. Kodama: How to conduct yourselves? You're not children.
(02/21 21:19:41) Jan Stepmeir: you know Nick White's scared of you .... you might want to talk to him, ease his fears a bit...
(02/21 21:19:50) Whilyam: There's something you'd never have said a couple years ago.
(02/21 21:19:56) Dr. Kodama: I talk to Nick fairly frequently.
(02/21 21:19:58) Slightperil: Do you know how the projection was made?
(02/21 21:20:24) Dr. Kodama: Don't know if it was a projection.
(02/21 21:20:30) Slightperil: Oh
(02/21 21:20:43) Arias: Wow, our little bevin is getting quite crowded
(02/21 21:20:48) Whilyam: Again.
(02/21 21:21:03) Ly'net: Yes it is
(02/21 21:21:10) Whilyam: Should we form a spiral? Dr. you could be in the center..
(02/21 21:21:22) Jan Stepmeir: lol
(02/21 21:21:26) Slightperil: How is progress coming with new areas in the city?
(02/21 21:21:28) Dr. Kodama: I have better things to do. Thank you though.
(02/21 21:21:37) Slightperil: What about the museum?
(02/21 21:21:47) Dr. Kodama: Delays, delays...
(02/21 21:21:48) Ly'net: Ow soon till that's open?
(02/21 21:21:56) Dr. Kodama: I would hope for next week.
(02/21 21:22:21) Erik: But on the DRC website it's stated that it was completed on January 4th?
(02/21 21:22:43) Dr. Kodama: Indeed.
(02/21 21:22:48) Dr. Kodama: Thank you for reading the site for me.
(02/21 21:22:58) Ly'net snickers
(02/21 21:23:04) Arias: Heh
(02/21 21:23:04) Slightperil: Is there anything in it?
(02/21 21:23:11) Dr. Kodama: A few small things.
(02/21 21:23:33) Dr. Kodama: Nothing major.
(02/21 21:23:49) Dr. Kodama: I would hope the doors would work correctly before we open it.
(02/21 21:23:52) Whilyam: I won't bother reading the site for you, Dr.. Why isn't it updated?
(02/21 21:23:54) Dr. Kodama: Although... who knows.
(02/21 21:24:19) Jan Stepmeir: can't you just lock the doors open?
(02/21 21:24:42) Dr. Kodama: Apparently not.
(02/21 21:24:45) Slightperil: What else are you working on just now?
(02/21 21:25:14) Dr. Kodama: Er'Cana.
(02/21 21:25:24) Jan Stepmeir: so supermarkets can lock their automatic doors open but the D'ni couldn't, interesting, lol
(02/21 21:25:51) Dr. Kodama: Supermarkets do have a hard time writing Books that link however.
(02/21 21:25:57) Ly'net: true
(02/21 21:26:11) Mikel: Do you have an estimation for Er'cana for us?
(02/21 21:26:30) Whilyam predicts "No."
(02/21 21:26:33) Dr. Kodama: At this point...
(02/21 21:26:55) Dr. Kodama: April or May...
(02/21 21:27:08) Slightperil: Wow thanks
(02/21 21:27:17) Dr. Kodama: Providing there are no more delays... which seem to be following us everywhere right now.
(02/21 21:27:56) Whilyam: Interested in a game of heek, Dr? :P
(02/21 21:28:00) Ly'net: dr. kodama, do you play heek?
(02/21 21:28:07) Dr. Kodama: At times.
(02/21 21:28:14) Ly'net: are you good at it?
(02/21 21:28:18) Dr. Kodama: Of course.
(02/21 21:28:23) Whilyam: Heh
(02/21 21:28:33) Slightperil: Are you planning any city interiors for the near future?
(02/21 21:29:05) Dr. Kodama: The Museum.
(02/21 21:29:28) Dr. Kodama: I think I've seen all I need to see.
(02/21 21:29:31) Dr. Kodama: Good day.
