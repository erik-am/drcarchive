[Note: The following lines were relayed by Wep]
Nick White: yeah, things don't go as planned down here most of the time... between yeesha, bahro, and the usual complications...
Nick White: i've been helping out kodama here and there...
Nick White: er'cana
Nick White: went to a weird age too
Nick White: long ways off I think.. mostly water
[Note: An edited transcript follows]
Sharaya: What age would that be?
Whilyam: Ahnonay?
Shaun Wallaby: Myst?
Nick White: We thought it was on track for release but I think it's been suspended...
Nick White: Not Ahnonay...although, I've been there as well.
Nick White: Short visit.
Shaun Wallaby: What's on this strange age? Landmarks and the likes?
Joel: Is there life as we know it?
Nick White: Yeah, water creatures.
Whilyam: Was that the reason it was suspended?
Nick White: D'ni were harvesting some kind of energy there I think...
Joel: Wait, was the age underwater? Or were you on land of any kind there?
Melodie: like shroomie?
spoonodoom: fish, or other water creatures?
Shaun Wallaby: Got me curious.
Nick White: No...never seen them before.
Nick White: Very little land.
Nick White: Mostly water and some man-made structures.
Sharaya: thanks for telling us about it
Nick White: You bet.
KL/RREN is a bit puzzled...
Joel: Cool.
Nick White: Just don't get me busted.
Shaun Wallaby: I'm just curious as always.
Melodie: we all are, that's why we're here
Shaun Wallaby: I hope we get to see this strange age one day.
Whilyam: Nick, do you know why it was/might be suspended?
Sharaya: Is Cate really mad about the release problems?
Nick White: Some of these places are just tough...
Nick White: Yes, she is.
Nick White: This Age was already delayed and now this...
Sharaya: Why does she hold so much power?
Nick White: You ever live with your parents when you were in college?
Nick White: Your parents ever say... "Live in my house and I pay the bills...you'll live under my rules..."
Nick White: She's paying the bills...
Nick White: It implies some leadership.
Sharaya: That makes sense
Nick White: I don't think she's acting like president or anything but...
Sharaya: Doesn't make it any easier for you though
Joel: So she's from GameTap, those anonymous folk who are funding the restoration?
Nick White: No.
Nick White: She's not from GameTap.
Joel: Huh! Curiouser.
Shaun Wallaby: Then what company?
Nick White: Her own.
Shaun Wallaby: Strange, it does say a lot about her.
Sharaya: Will this latest setback with Delin affect the new area of the city that was supposed to be opened today?
Melodie: Interesting, an investor without a big name?
Nick White: Uh, what was the new area of the city?
Nick White: I don't know of one.
Joel: So there aren't any plans on opening anything any time soon that you know of?
Nick White: No single investor - she raies money, working with companies, for a living
Sharaya: The DRC did mention opening more of this city today
Nick White: I don't know about that.
Nick White: Last big city thing I know of was the Great Zero.
Sharaya: And that was great!
Joel: Is the Great Zero fully functional, awaiting calibration by us? Or are there parts of it that still need work?
Justin: will the DRC ever put the rest of the missing books in the Hall of Kings?
steve van cleef: she could be descended from an ancient d'ni family who migrated to the surface
Jan Stepmeir: It just seems counterintuitive that the DRC would open up the GZ first and the rest of Ae'gura second
[Note:At this point, Nick moves from near the Palace Alcove to inside the Hall of Kings.]
Sharaya: Do you mind being followed around?
Nick White: Yeah we should put those in here I guess...
From Wep in D'ni-Ae'gura: SHOTS FIRED I repeat shots fired!...ok just kidding
Justin: ri'nerif espesially
Justin: And Kerath
Whilyam: Kerath as well
Sharaya: well, it must be unnerving to have people following you around everywhere
Whilyam: We're like the Kemo bugs
Jan Stepmeir: It's to be expected
Nick White: I know what it's like to be Britney Spears.
Shaun Wallaby: oh?
achren: ha
Sudre laughs
Nadnerb: .....
Andrew Yosso starts to laugh
Justin roars with laughter
Whilyam: Yikes!
Jan Stepmeir: So you wear skirts and flash for the camera?
Shaun Wallaby: Having drooling fans follow you around. :)
Andrew Yosso laughs
Nick White: Ha..
Nick White: I'll leave that to her.
Nick White: I don't look good in skirts.
Dragonia: not even a kilt?
Justin: is it possible for a DRC member to spontaniously open areas of the city?
Nick White: Only if I'm in Braveheart.
Nick White: Nope.
Nick White: Not possible.
S'am: is it possible for the DRC to spontaniously do anything?
Nick White: Yep.
Justin: what?
Nick White: Open an Age.
Shaun Wallaby: It does make me think about the DRC. It's future mostly.
Nick White: I wouldn't count on it but it's possible.
Sharaya: So, would you do that for us? Open and age today?
Whilyam: Well they didn't do that well.
Nick White: Sorry... nope.
Nick White: I will tell you that Sharper called again.
Whilyam: Yes, Nick. You seemed to be able to get into places before. You couldn't sneak some of us into Delin?
Whilyam: Oh?
Nadnerb: if they know, it wouldn't be spontaneous
Whilyam: Now THAT is interesting.
Nick White: Rumor has it he talked to Cate.
Mari': What did Sharper have to say?
Nick White: Funny.
Joel: Did he walk away with his skin intact?
Sharaya: But you don't know what he said?
Nick White: I didn't talk to him this time.
Whilyam: I wouldn't think Cate would stand for him.
Sharaya: Cate didn't say anything about the conversation?
Nick White: Who knows... a lot has changed since Sharper was here...
Joel: Why doesn't Cate wear a KI? How does she access the Nexus?
Nick White: I don't talk to Cate that much.
Nick White: She has a flesh colored KI.
Nick White: Kidding.
Sharaya: how did you know she talked to Sharper then?
Whilyam: Do you know if Sharper's planning on coming downand talking to
the explorers any time soon?
Joel: Hah. I thought you were serious for a second. Had me going.
Nick White: I said rumors.
Sharaya: Ah
spoonodoom: did you hear any rumours about what they talked about?
Nick White: Yeah...
Whilyam: But you know for certain Sharper's back?
Nick White: Sharper isn't back.
Shaun Wallaby: Thought so.
djlumberjack: did he make a robot imitation of himself?
Whilyam: This is confusing. You said Sharper had called.
Nick White: Yes. He's a robot now.
Nick White: Sharper has a phone.
Nick White: So does Cate - on the surface.
Joel: No, Sharper's ALWAYS been a robot! *gasp* *shock* *awe*
Nick White: These things called cell phones.
Nick White: Amazing.
Whilyam: Ah, so he is back.
Whilyam: Just not back here.
Sharaya: If Sharper is a robot, who made him?
Nick White: DRC
Nick White: Not like that office is "secret" anymore.
Nick White: Yes.
spoonodoom: what rumours did you hear about Sharper and Cate's conversation?
Nick White: I gotta get running...
Nick White: Not anything juicy...
Whilyam: Okay. Shorah Nick.
Joel: Thanks for visiting us, Nick!
Sharaya: Thanks for taking the time to talk to us
djlumberjack thanks you
Nick White: See you guys later.
spoonodoom: thanks, nick!
Joel: We always like visits from you.
Shaun Wallaby: Bye
Justin: bye
Altydwarber: thanks Nick and see you
Melodie: ok, have a good day
Nadnerb: bye nick
Nick White: Hope so.
Dav'on: Shorah, Nick.
Nick White: No idea if it'll be up though.
S'am: thanks for the info and for tolerating the crowds :)
