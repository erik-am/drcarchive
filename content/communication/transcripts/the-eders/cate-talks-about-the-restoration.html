(02/03 00:01:38) Cate Alexander: Good, good.
(02/03 00:01:42) Firesign: nice picture of you :)
(02/03 00:01:44) Azeltir: However...
(02/03 00:01:50) Cate Alexander: Ah, thank you.
(02/03 00:01:54) Azeltir: Your first sentance ends with a preposition!
(02/03 00:02:01) Firesign: lol
(02/03 00:02:06) Cate Alexander: I'll talk to the editors.
(02/03 00:02:13) Cate Alexander: Maybe fire them...
(02/03 00:02:13) Rebekah: shorah
(02/03 00:02:15) Firesign: im glad to see the update
(02/03 00:02:19) Azeltir: Thanks, just looking out for the grammarian cause.
(02/03 00:02:32) Azeltir: It's pretty, though, and I love the new timeline.
(02/03 00:02:37) Cate Alexander: Great.
(02/03 00:02:41) Cate Alexander: Glad to hear.
(02/03 00:02:43) Xavius links in, then tosses a bottle of purple smoke at the ground to look mysterious.
(02/03 00:02:57) Azeltir: Very mysterious, Xavius.
(02/03 00:03:08) Azeltir: So, what's new with the resoration?
(02/03 00:03:12) Xavius: I try.
(02/03 00:03:13) Firesign: any idea on when the library barriers will come down, cate?
(02/03 00:03:25) Cate Alexander: Hopefully soon. Things have bogged down a bit.
(02/03 00:03:28) Azeltir: They are already, Firesign.
(02/03 00:03:33) Cate Alexander: Some debate within the DRC.
(02/03 00:03:35) Xavius: Not the inner ones.
(02/03 00:03:38) Cate Alexander: I think we are working it out...
(02/03 00:03:39) Azeltir: Or, the ones to the library itself?
(02/03 00:03:50) Firesign: thats great
(02/03 00:04:00) Xavius bows
(02/02 22:03:58) jetuser: Cate i have a really quick question
(02/02 22:04:00) Cate Alexander: I had hoped to keep things moving but there are those who don't have the same hopes.
(02/02 22:04:03) Cate Alexander: Yes, of course.
(02/02 22:04:04) jetuser: Any more news on sharper?
(02/02 22:04:13) Cate Alexander: I did have a conversation with him.
(02/02 22:04:16) Cate Alexander: A while ago.
(02/02 22:04:18) jetuser: And what did he say?
(02/02 22:04:18) Cate Alexander: Short.
(02/02 22:04:25) Firesign: who doesnt, cate? victor?
(02/02 22:04:42) Cate Alexander: I think he just wanted to talk, to get to know me a bit.
(02/02 22:04:46) Xavius: What about Dr. Watson?
(02/02 22:04:52) Cate Alexander: I have not heard a thing.
(02/02 22:04:54) Azeltir: So, I saw a lot of phase five ages. Can we get a brief description of them?
(02/02 22:05:01) Xavius nods.
(02/02 22:05:02) Azeltir: On the website, that is.
(02/02 22:05:02) Cate Alexander: Of the Ages?
(02/02 22:05:07) Cate Alexander: Ah... maybe.
(02/02 22:05:12) Azeltir laughs
(02/02 22:05:19) Azeltir: Meaning what?
(02/02 22:05:33) Cate Alexander: Meaning...maybe.
(02/02 22:05:36) Leonor: Shorah
(02/02 22:05:39) Azeltir: Even a couple words about them would be fun.
(02/02 22:05:40) Firesign: maybe a couple of cameraphone pics? ;)
(02/02 22:05:41) jetuser: Well i'm more interested in Dereno
(02/02 22:05:44) Lemonhead: hmmm... could you speak a bit about these ages that are closer to being opened?
(02/02 22:05:45) jetuser: since that's new to me
(02/02 22:05:46) Cate Alexander: We may put up brief descriptions of the Ages or we may not.
(02/02 22:05:57) Azeltir: I have to say, that would be lovely.
(02/02 22:06:04) Cate Alexander: Noted.
(02/02 22:06:09) Rebekah: hello leonor and moietay
(02/02 22:06:09) Leonor: A brief description would be nice.
(02/02 22:06:11) Azeltir: Do we know where these firemarbles came from?
(02/02 22:06:14) Barbarra: It would be nice to know how to dress and so on.
(02/02 22:06:16) Arya Anna: just whisper in our ears, we won't tell ;)
(02/02 22:06:16) *Moietay: Shorah!
(02/02 22:06:25) jetuser: Oh, by the way, assuming kirel gets released, will the current neighborhoods be cycled between the two?
(02/02 22:06:29) jetuser: ooh a colored firestone
(02/02 22:06:32) Rebekah: i love firemarbles!
(02/02 22:06:35) Cate Alexander: Some of the phase five Ages are fairly small. Contained.
(02/02 22:06:45) Barbarra: Ah.
(02/02 22:06:47) Rebekah: hmm
(02/02 22:06:52) Cate Alexander: Thus we've been able to work through them much quicker than normal.
(02/02 22:07:09) Butch waves hello
(02/02 22:07:09) Rebekah: yes
(02/02 22:07:16) Azeltir: Are they islands, or like pods?
(02/02 22:07:20) jetuser: What about kirel? Will neighborhoods be allowed to follow the kirel layout assuming it is released?
(02/02 22:07:21) Cate Alexander: Smaller ages are easier, given our staffing.
(02/02 22:07:31) Firesign: we'll be seeing tsogal soon, i imagine?
(02/02 22:07:39) Cate Alexander: I hope.
(02/02 22:07:50) Firesign: good
(02/02 22:07:56) Cate Alexander: That is the plan.
(02/02 22:08:01) Lemonhead: hey, I have a question... it seems that Ae`gura is divided in districts, like Kerath`em district, etc... so what`s the name of the district we have acces to right now?
(02/02 22:08:05) Firesign: plans are good :)
(02/02 22:08:14) Rebekah: so it is still on schedule?
(02/02 22:08:19) jetuser: Oh, by the way, can i apply to be a Restoration Engineer? :)
(02/02 22:08:31) *Moietay: Hehe...on that note, count me in :P
(02/02 22:08:43) jetuser: Yeah I think a lot of people would want to become a Res Eng
(02/02 22:08:53) Xavius gives Eddie a better look.
(02/02 22:08:53) jetuser: but i've always been interested in the art
(02/02 22:08:57) Firesign: oh, another quick question. how is victor doing on the great zero?
(02/02 22:09:19) Cate Alexander: Great zero is coming along. We had a small setback for future plans but it's coming along.
(02/02 22:09:32) Firesign: lattice problems?
(02/02 22:09:35) Azeltir: Will we explorers be helping out with the calibration?
(02/02 22:09:37) Barbarra leans left
(02/02 22:09:48) Lemonhead: I guess my question about the name of the city district got ignored... lol
(02/02 22:09:48) Xavius tries to be funny
(02/02 22:09:56) Cate Alexander: Sorry.
(02/02 22:10:03) Cate Alexander: I'm not sure to be exact.
(02/02 22:10:11) Xavius: Ah.
(02/02 22:10:14) Barbarra: The city district is Ae'gura
(02/02 22:10:15) Lemonhead: oh, that`s fine
(02/02 22:10:17) Xavius: Private Room.
(02/02 22:10:20) Cate Alexander: A few have been mentioned.
(02/02 22:10:20) jetuser: I'm pretty sure its one of the mid to lower ones
(02/02 22:10:20) Xavius: Oop.
(02/02 22:10:22) Barbarra: The whole cavern is the city proper.
(02/02 22:10:26) Lemonhead: Ae`gura is divided in many districts, Barbarra
(02/02 22:10:30) jetuser: Because atrus mentions the pub in his journals as in the middle district
(02/02 22:10:31) Lemonhead: they all have different names
(02/02 22:10:33) Cate Alexander: Ishah for one.
(02/02 22:10:37) Xavius: Emphasis on many.
(02/02 22:10:51) Cate Alexander: I'm not we know exactly where the lines were drawn... we may have opened areas of a few.
(02/02 22:10:52) Barbarra: Ae'gura is the one Island, not the whole city.
(02/02 22:10:57) Firesign: oh, speaking of the pub. any chance of that being opened soon? :)
(02/02 22:11:00) Cate Alexander: I'm not the best to ask.
(02/02 22:11:30) Sorceress: I'm glad that the DRC is working city interiors. Are they more pulblic buildings, or actual D'ni homes?
(02/02 22:11:34) Cate Alexander: We have plans to use it... as far as opening it, it was always associated with Kahlo and I'm not sure how soon Kahlo will be able to get here.
(02/02 22:11:45) Firesign: ahh, ok
(02/02 22:12:10) jetuser: What about the Res Eng question, will us mere explorers be able to become one eventually?
(02/02 22:12:11) Xavius: Also, just wondering, since it's just an idea that I had. Do the Doors we see on walkways and places in bevin ever have a chance of leading anywhere?
(02/02 22:12:14) Barbarra: We could certainly use a place to sit in the city.
(02/02 22:12:19) Xavius: I was just thinking about it today, is all.
(02/02 22:12:21) Cate Alexander: We are not currently taking applications.
(02/02 22:12:23) *Moietay: Are there any future plans for seeing more of the garden Ages, for example the garden area of Eder Gira?
(02/02 22:12:40) Xavius: Eder Gira has another area?
(02/02 22:12:40) jetuser: well eder tsogal is coming
(02/02 22:12:42) jetuser: that counts
(02/02 22:12:51) Azeltir: Mm, about Eder Delin, did the DRC approve of the Journey door that was oh so inviting to us explorers?
(02/02 22:12:53) Xavius: Tsogahl's an Eder?
(02/02 22:12:55) jetuser: yeah
(02/02 22:12:56) Cate Alexander: We'd love to open more of Gira.
(02/02 22:12:57) *Moietay: I meant, more areas of the previously released ages.
(02/02 22:13:01) Butch: Ms. Alexander, There are 3 ages flagged removed from list. 1.22.07. why were those ages 'removed'?
(02/02 22:13:01) Firesign: yes, xav
(02/02 22:13:01) jetuser: its called eder tsogal for a reason lol
(02/02 22:13:07) Cate Alexander: I"ll need to raise more funding.
(02/02 22:13:08) *Moietay: Great, I would love to see more of that Age :D.
(02/02 22:13:13) Xavius leans left
(02/02 22:13:30) Cate Alexander: We felt it better to not have them on the public list.
(02/02 22:14:10) Azeltir: Is there any hope, like many of us have maintained, that we'll be able to explore Katran's Torus Age?
(02/02 22:14:17) Azeltir: Or that of Tay?
(02/02 22:14:17) Xavius: What of Sohvokhbahr?
(02/02 22:14:18) Firesign: was the question about the firemarbles answered? where they came from?
(02/02 22:14:18) *Moietay: Ooh...Torus :D
(02/02 22:14:20) Cate Alexander: I'm not sure I'm familiar with that one?
(02/02 22:14:36) Xavius: That's what they all say..
(02/02 22:14:38) Azeltir: Torus was Catherine (Katran)'s first Age.
(02/02 22:14:45) Cate Alexander: We scattered the marbles.
(02/02 22:14:48) Whalyn: Is there any way we can help with the fund raising... to sort of hurry things along some?
(02/02 22:14:50) *Moietay: It is described in the Book of Atrus.
(02/02 22:14:56) Barbarra: I'm not sure there was ever a link to that here.
(02/02 22:14:58) Firesign: ahh, so theyre from the drc then. thanks.
(02/02 22:15:10) Azeltir: I love the marbles. Thanks, DRC.
(02/02 22:15:23) Barbarra: I notice excavations in the guild hall--
(02/02 22:15:27) Cate Alexander: The fact that you are here is helping the fundraising. The more people the more money companies will be willing to contribute.
(02/02 22:15:29) Firesign: yeah, i like the colored ones. nice change. :)
(02/02 22:15:42) Cate Alexander: Numbers... always comes down to numbers.
(02/02 22:15:46) Barbarra: Could you tell us if anything has been found beneath the Guild Hall?
(02/02 22:15:51) Cate Alexander: Yes.
(02/02 22:15:52) jetuser: Ah i know this is kinda random, but there's been a bit of chatter about an apparent spiral pathway seen in the city, do you know anything about it?
(02/02 22:15:52) Firesign: money talks
(02/02 22:15:58) Cate Alexander: I don't.
(02/02 22:16:02) jetuser: On one of the spires in the city
(02/02 22:16:04) Xavius plays with red firemarble in enthusiasm.
(02/02 22:16:18) jetuser: People were saying it leads to the Guild hall?
(02/02 22:16:28) Cate Alexander: I don't believe so...
(02/02 22:16:42) Barbarra: Are you looking for the tomb of the great king beneath the Guild hall?
(02/02 22:17:08) Sorceress: Maybe it's better to let dead Kings alone.
(02/02 22:17:13) Cate Alexander: We are carefully advancing as far as we can in the temple beneath the Hall although it's very dangerous and slow work.
(02/02 22:17:20) Azeltir: Also, will someone else take over Teledahn now that Sharper's gone?
(02/02 22:17:20) jetuser: Well it was speculation is all, its been there for a long time, i was just wondering what the pathway on the spire was
(02/02 22:17:23) Barbarra: I can certainly understand that.
(02/02 22:17:24) Cate Alexander: Currently not happenign at all.
(02/02 22:17:57) Cate Alexander: I should be moving along. Visit some different neighborhoods. Good talking to you all...
