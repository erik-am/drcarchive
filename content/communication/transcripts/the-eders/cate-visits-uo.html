(01/19 00:52:40) Cate Alexander: Thank you.
(01/19 00:52:42) Talazian waves hello
(01/19 00:52:43) Aurelian: oh, the disgruntled citizen they speak about in the beginner's tour?
(01/19 00:52:48) Cate Alexander: Everyone doing well?
(01/19 00:53:00) J'mee: Welcome to UO, Cate
(01/19 00:53:02) Talazian: sure am
(01/19 00:53:08) Cate Alexander: I'm
(01/19 00:53:09) pHluid13: yeah.. torturous waiting..
(01/19 00:53:09) Vortmax: Very well, I think. :)
(01/19 00:53:17) Aurelian: Well I gotts to go, latas.
(01/19 00:53:21) Cate Alexander: curious to know if any of you have any comments regarding the DRC site...
(01/19 00:53:25) Vortmax: We're all chomping at the bit to explore Eder Delin :)
(01/19 00:53:40) Whilyam: Age list needs to be updated, Mrs. Alexander
(01/19 00:53:44) J'mee: Well, I like the site. I frequent it every so often.
(01/19 00:53:53) pHluid13: as i understand it doesn't look to be updated in a while.. so i stopped cheking..
(01/19 00:53:55) Talazian: Haven't been there today
(01/19 00:53:56) Vortmax: Updates all over the site would be great.
(01/19 00:53:58) Cate Alexander: What would you like to see on it?
(01/19 00:54:03) Whilyam: Perhaps more frequent updates from the DRC, such as issues inside Ages.
(01/19 00:54:16) J'mee: Yes, progress reports about Age restoration
(01/19 00:54:22) Whilyam: I liked reading about little news bits likt "moved styrofoam to Teledahn" etc.
(01/19 00:55:12) From DonnaDillon in Uru Obsession's Bevin: The more details the better ;-)
(01/19 00:55:37) J'mee: Uh, yeah Whilyam, can you elaborate on that?
(01/19 00:55:39) Whilyam: Indeed. No need to make Victor pll out any more of his hair. :P
(01/19 00:55:45) Whilyam: pull*
(01/19 00:55:48) J'mee: Vic has hair?
(01/19 00:55:56) Whilyam: Last time I checked. :P
(01/19 00:55:56) Vortmax: Less every day, J'mee :)
(01/19 00:56:18) Cate Alexander: Let us worry about schedules and when we need to be pushed...
(01/19 00:56:30) Vortmax: Could we get a look at some Age reports on the site? That could be interesting to read.
(01/19 00:56:38) Cate Alexander: Right.
(01/19 00:56:39) J'mee: Perhaps the DRC could post some pictures as they are restoring Ages, even before they are ready for Explorers
(01/19 00:56:42) Whilyam: I agree, Vort.
(01/19 00:56:53) From DonnaDillon in Uru Obsession's Bevin: Oh that would be nice!
(01/19 00:56:56) Whilyam: Progress and updates to reflect the current situation.
(01/19 00:57:02) pHluid13: as i understand it.. when someone says they should have something ready, it should be ready, right?
(01/19 00:57:03) Cate Alexander: It seems the consensus is more information on Ages we are working on. More information of any kind...
(01/19 00:57:06) Cate Alexander: Very well...
(01/19 00:57:11) Vortmax: Well, even early reports from current Ages could be very fun to read.
(01/19 00:57:13) Cate Alexander: I'll make a note of it.
(01/19 00:57:22) J'mee: I'd like info on any wildlife they encounter.
(01/19 00:57:28) Whilyam: Perhaps Victor could add some sounds and pictures from an Age?
(01/19 00:57:29) J'mee: THAT would be interesting
(01/19 00:57:30) Vortmax: We always want more ;)
(01/19 00:57:32) BrettM: Yes, and I would like to see the old Age detail pages restored.
(01/19 00:57:43) pHluid13: yeah it seems like most of the time we just sit here and wait for the drc to do something.. it would be nice to have something to do in the meantine
(01/19 00:58:00) J'mee: One thing that I've been wishing - the old timeline that one could clickon to see the old Age reports
(01/19 00:58:00) Vortmax: Could I ask an unreleated question?
(01/19 00:58:12) Cate Alexander: Shoot away.
(01/19 00:58:52) Vortmax: Many of the explorers have expertise which could be useful to the Restoration, and would love to volunteer. Would you be interested in making use of them? Many would be happy just helping to clear rubble :)
(01/19 00:59:16) Vortmax: Down the road, not next week or anything :)
(01/19 00:59:36) J'mee: Cate, would you be able to shed any light on what has happened to Dr. Watson?
(01/19 00:59:37) Cate Alexander: Right... it's in our long range plans but difficult to implement.
(01/19 00:59:49) Cate Alexander: I can not... I have no idea where Dr. Watson is.
(01/19 00:59:49) J'mee: Has anyone spoken with him recently?
(01/19 00:59:51) Vortmax: Understood. I'm just glad to know you're thinking about it. :)
(01/19 00:59:54) Whilyam: And about pushing. Yes, it is your responsbility, however, take care to remember the past, Cate. We don't need a repeat of Phil's "incident."
(01/19 00:59:57) Cate Alexander: No that I'm aware of.
(01/19 01:00:24) BrettM: Ms. Alexander, are you taking any steps to investigate Dr. Watson's or Phil Henderson's whereabouts?
(01/19 01:00:30) Cate Alexander: Thank you Whilyam - I'm well aware of proper safety measures...
(01/19 01:00:37) Whilyam: Good.
(01/19 01:00:38) J'mee: No sign of Phil was ever found...
(01/19 01:00:38) Cate Alexander: No.
(01/19 01:00:59) Cate Alexander: This can be a dangerous place.
[Note: At this point Ms. Alexander suddenly vanishes. Several minutes later she returns.]
(01/19 01:28:54) BrettM: welcome back, Ms. Alexander.
(01/19 01:29:03) Cate Alexander: Sorry about that.
(01/19 01:29:09) Vortmax: Hello again Cate! It would seem this place CAN be dangerous...
(01/19 01:29:16) Cate Alexander: Funny timing.
(01/19 01:29:23) Vortmax: We were quite amused :)
(01/19 01:29:25) Cate Alexander: Next thing I knew I was heading to my Relto.
(01/19 01:29:44) Cate Alexander: I didn't need any rumors started so I figured I neede to return and let you know I wasn't snatched away by a Bahro.
(01/19 01:30:00) Butch: Oh, good evening, Ms. Alexander.
(01/19 01:30:03) BrettM: What explanation do you have, then?
(01/19 01:30:15) Cate Alexander: I don't have one at all.
(01/19 01:30:38) Vortmax: DESTRUCTION IS COMING!
(01/19 01:30:38) Vortmax: That's my explanation
(01/19 01:30:43) BrettM: No, magic linking abilities? B-)
(01/19 01:30:48) Cate Alexander: Hmm..yes, not if I can help it.
(01/19 01:30:59) Cate Alexander: Sorry..I'm not Yeesha.
(01/19 01:31:15) BrettM: That's pretty clear. No tattoos.
(01/19 01:31:17) Cate Alexander: Regardless, thanks for the input on the website.
(01/19 01:31:26) Vortmax: Ah, but there was that theory that you were Yeesha's daughter...
(01/19 01:31:27) Vortmax starts to laugh
(01/19 01:31:30) Cate Alexander: I'll consider and pass them along.
(01/19 01:31:34) BrettM laughs
(01/19 01:31:35) pHluid13: I have a great question to ask of you Cate..
(01/19 01:31:44) Cate Alexander: Yes, one more and I do need to get going.
(01/19 01:31:45) pHluid13: have you ever seen a Bahro?
(01/19 01:31:57) Whilyam: On that topic, Cate. . Perhaps have the Main DRC list their favorite Ages? Might add to the "friendlier DRC"
(01/19 01:32:15) pHluid13: in person
(01/19 01:32:23) Cate Alexander: I've seen things that I think are Bahro but who is to know....
(01/19 01:32:46) Gondar: ...figures I get here just as Cate has to go :-(
(01/19 01:32:49) BrettM: Then you haven't taken Yeesha's journey?
(01/19 01:33:01) Cate Alexander: I have.
(01/19 01:33:02) Gondar is a bit upset...
(01/19 01:33:03) pHluid13: i know.. seems like our time with Cate is always limited..
(01/19 01:33:19) Cate Alexander: I am buys.
(01/19 01:33:19) pHluid13: Cate: you should really talk to the DRC about you staying in cavern more often....
(01/19 01:33:25) Cate Alexander: Busy.
(01/19 01:33:30) Vortmax: Oh, she's in the Cavern, just busy elsewhere :)
(01/19 01:33:31) Gondar: That's ok, Ms. Alexander.. it's my own bad luck.
(01/19 01:33:42) Gondar: I haven't seen a single DRC except in passing since I returned...
(01/19 01:33:55) pHluid13: but we just enjoy your company.. and you simply dont visit often enough.. :)
(01/19 01:33:56) Ashtar: Looks like I came in at the wrong time, but it was good to finally meet up with you Cate.
(01/19 01:33:56) Time: I heard you were asking for suggestions about the DRC website? If that's the case Might i request some mention fo the site on a document or two here in the cavern.
(01/19 01:34:03) Cate Alexander: The DRC is busy as well. Everyone tries to find time here at least a bit but it's hard.
(01/19 01:34:13) Cate Alexander: You want new Ages, I would presume, more than visits...
(01/19 01:34:22) Butch: Ms. Alexander, some of the other explorers were asking if the DRC had anything to say about the Explorer meeting this last Saturday.
(01/19 01:34:35) Cate Alexander: I'm not sure I'm aware of the meeting...
(01/19 01:34:35) Whilyam: Yes, but I also like to hear how things are going.
(01/19 01:34:39) pHluid13: true, i shoose an age over you any day.. just kidding..
(01/19 01:34:44) Cate Alexander: What meeting?
(01/19 01:35:03) Whilyam: An Explorere meeting
(01/19 01:35:12) Butch: Just a group that got together to talk about things.
(01/19 01:35:19) Whilyam: About many things like communication in the Cavern.
(01/19 01:35:30) Cate Alexander: And was there something worrisome about this group?
(01/19 01:35:38) Whilyam: We thought the DRC might wantto use the KImail system more
(01/19 01:35:42) Cate Alexander: I assume explorers get together all the time to talk about things.
(01/19 01:35:49) Whilyam: Not in such numbers, Cate.
(01/19 01:35:58) Cate Alexander: Very good.
(01/19 01:35:58) J'mee: Yeah, KI mail is very underutilized
(01/19 01:36:15) Cate Alexander: We use KI Mail when we see the need.
(01/19 01:36:29) Whilyam: KI mail and the Imagers. Those were stated as the best ways to increase news flow in cavern.
(01/19 01:36:34) Cate Alexander: But with all of our procedures, we are looking at improvements. I'll keep your thoughts in mind.
(01/19 01:36:41) Time agrees with Whilyam
(01/19 01:36:44) Vortmax: Thanks. That's all we can ask.
(01/19 01:36:47) BrettM: That's very good to hear.
(01/19 01:36:48) J'mee: Thank you
(01/19 01:37:01) Cate Alexander: Of course.
(01/19 01:37:05) Time: Thanks, Cate. Glad to see you asking for our opinions. ^_^
(01/19 01:37:08) pHluid13: Thank You Cate for the visit and follow up
(01/19 01:37:17) J'mee: Has anyone suggested imagers around the City for message postings?
(01/19 01:37:24) Cate Alexander: Yes.
(01/19 01:37:28) J'mee: okay
(01/19 01:37:38) Whilyam: There are some in the Kahlo Pub that may work well for that.
(01/19 01:37:45) Vortmax: Yes, perhaps you could get the imager in the pub working
(01/19 01:37:54) Vortmax: That could be ideal
(01/19 01:38:08) Time once again agrees with Whilyam, and Vortmax.
(01/19 01:38:21) Cate Alexander: We have brought that up as well.
(01/19 01:38:22) Gondar: Next step we need is KI chat channels, and on-KI bulletin board system for quick discussion.. :-)
(01/19 01:38:25) Whilyam: Perhaps even hanging some others around the City with news from the Cavern.
(01/19 01:38:44) Cate Alexander: There is much that can be done - some of it we will get to faster than others.
(01/19 01:38:48) BrettM: Or perhaps a large imager in the community room for broadcasts.
(01/19 01:39:01) Gondar: Yeah, larger imagers that hold more text..
(01/19 01:39:04) Cate Alexander: We'll all have to live with the pace but trust I have noted your concerns.
(01/19 01:39:04) Vortmax: Well, just keep them in mind for the future :)
(01/19 01:39:15) J'mee: Once, long ago, there was a very nice Cavern Today newsletter, with columns.
(01/19 01:39:17) Gondar: It's ok... we can be patient.
(01/19 01:39:20) Whilyam: Unrelated question, Cate. Do you know when the other Eder, Tsogahl, will be ready to be released?
(01/19 01:39:22) pHluid13: We trust you wont let us down Cate..
(01/19 01:39:29) Cate Alexander: Thank you for your time...I do need to get along to another meeting. A final check of Delin.
(01/19 01:39:37) Gondar cheers
(01/19 01:39:38) Vortmax: Good luck! We can't wait!
(01/19 01:39:41) Whilyam claps his hands
(01/19 01:39:44) Time: Yup. I can wait as long as it takes. It's just good to hear you're thinking of solutions to things and working on them.
(01/19 01:39:45) LdyDrgn claps her hands
(01/19 01:39:45) Ashtar: Need any help Cate? :)
(01/19 01:39:46) pHluid13: Cate: can we come with you? lol
(01/19 01:39:46) imara: Thank you
(01/19 01:39:49) BrettM: TThank you for YOUR time.
(01/19 01:39:49) J'mee: Thanks, again for stopping by!
(01/19 01:39:52) Vortmax thinkgs good thoughts about Delin's weather
(01/19 01:39:52) Cate Alexander: Yes, it will be good to release something new.
(01/19 01:40:01) Cate Alexander: We'll talk to you later.
