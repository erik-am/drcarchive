(02/06 21:33:14) Michael Engberg waves hello
(02/06 21:33:35)  Prometheus: The bridge seems to be holding out.
(02/06 21:33:53)  Michael Engberg: A few more inspections. How is everything going?
(02/06 21:34:32)  Prometheus: Great!  I haven't been down for a few days, so I'm not sure what's new to be found.
(02/06 21:34:44)  Michael Engberg: This is still a bit unsafe.
(02/06 21:34:53)  Berric: Where do you take your head's hair,i don't have this one in my relto
(02/06 21:35:09)  Maxsilver:  whats not safe?
(02/06 21:35:10)  Prometheus: This opening in the wall?
(02/06 21:35:31) Michael Engberg: Yes. Should have more barriers here.
(02/06 21:35:37) Ekk waves hello
(02/06 21:35:52) Berric: you have reason to
(02/06 21:36:01) Maxsilver: I think we'll manage to not fall in
(02/06 21:36:10) Prometheus: A little water never heard anyone.
(02/06 21:36:15) Michael Engberg: Good.
(02/06 21:36:20) Sorceress: yeah, I know better than to take a dip in cavern water.
(02/06 21:36:22) Prometheus: *hurt
(02/06 21:37:01) Michael Engberg: How's the library area? I need a final inspection over there.
(02/06 21:37:15) Sorceress: Same as it ever was.
(02/06 21:37:26) Michael Engberg: Cate's moving fast. It's mostly good.
(02/06 21:37:33) Myst'Aken: It still got those barriers though
(02/06 21:37:54) Sorceress: I thought you wanted things to slow down, that its been too rushed?
(02/06 21:38:39) Michael Engberg: I'd like to slow down the cavern exploration. I still want to be cautious.
(02/06 21:39:01) Maxsilver: why? whats to be afraid of?
(02/06 21:39:04) Sorceress: I see. Must be hard to take your time with all the cool things down here.
(02/06 21:39:14) Michael Engberg: But Cate wants to move very quickly.
(02/06 21:39:19) Hu K'hanDhat: the library area seems safe Mr. Engberg
(02/06 21:39:54) Michael Engberg: I don't mean to frustrate everyone. I'm just naturally cautious. There are other things as well.
(02/06 21:39:57) Amrak is amazed!
(02/06 21:40:05) E'nitra: Such as??
(02/06 21:40:07) Marjan: Other things?
(02/06 21:40:10) Amrak: So many people
(02/06 21:40:29) Michael Engberg: It's not just things in the cavern that change quickly these days.
(02/06 21:40:46) Donna: business concerns?
(02/06 21:40:55) E'nitra: what else is changing then?
(02/06 21:41:04) Hu K'hanDhat: could you explain that last remark mr. Engberg
(02/06 21:41:19) Michael Engberg: Business, communications, meetings, web sites...
(02/06 21:41:28) Marjan: :-)
(02/06 21:41:53) Prometheus: Nice website by the way.
(02/06 21:42:00) Whilyam: websites... Be sure to mention to Cate that many explorers don't like that the DRC forums are down.
(02/06 21:42:00) Hu K'hanDhat: i understand
(02/06 21:42:03) Thumbs up from Marjan
(02/06 21:42:05) Michael Engberg: I don't buy into all of the changes. But I'm stubborn I suppose.
(02/06 21:42:22) Michael Engberg: I don't like that the forums are down either.
(02/06 21:42:26) Myst'Aken: PuLease ??
(02/06 21:42:43) Whilyam: No voice chat, please...
(02/06 21:42:47) Hu K'hanDhat: well, a bit of stubborness could just balance things out ... in my experience
(02/06 21:42:53) Whilyam cheers
(02/06 21:42:55) Sorceress: If I may request something, could the DRC maybe archive the old forums? A lot of good informational posts were there that we'd like to keep for posterity.
(02/06 21:42:57) Whilyam: Glad to hear that
(02/06 21:43:07) Whilyam: Yes, there was much progress made there.
(02/06 21:43:14) Gadren: Shorah!
(02/06 21:43:17) Michael Engberg: Just ashame to lose the forums - on top of everything else.
(02/06 21:43:43) URU_Plum: i hear u five by five
(02/06 21:43:44) Whilyam: Understand, but please stop. It's generating lag... at least for me it is
(02/06 21:43:45) Gadren: where is everyone?
(02/06 21:43:58) Sorceress: We're by the walkway to the library Gad.
(02/06 21:44:03) Whilyam: Thanks
(02/06 21:44:05) Gadren: thanks
(02/06 21:44:14) Marjan: Was it ms Alexanders idea to take them down?
(02/06 21:44:19) Michael Engberg: I'll see what I can do. But Cate seems to think nobody cares that much.
(02/06 21:44:23) Hu K'hanDhat: any news on the light in the docks section mr. engberg?
(02/06 21:44:40) E'nitra: Well the let her know we do!!
(02/06 21:44:51) Myst'Aken: She didn't really give us time to respond yesterday
(02/06 21:45:08) Michael Engberg: Yeah it was Cate's idea, but she had other support.
(02/06 21:45:18) Whilyam: Aye. Tell her she'll have riots soon if she doesn't have some sort of forum up.
(02/06 21:45:18) Michael Engberg: But I didn't agree.
(02/06 21:45:36) Whilyam: I liked seeing small reports of progress.
(02/06 21:45:42) Sorceress: Maybe if there was an active effort to moderate the DRC forums, there would be less trolling there. I left because I couldn't stand the nasty atmosphere there.
(02/06 21:45:54) Whilyam: I also miss the Sights and Sounds section. That's pretty much gone too.
(02/06 21:46:05) Sorceress: I know, add yet anohter job to the pile.
(02/06 21:46:15) Berric: the fact to be all here together is cause of lags
(02/06 21:46:17) Michael Engberg: I might not threaten her with riots, but I will express some of your opinion if you don't mind.
(02/06 21:46:28) Whilyam: Thank you.
(02/06 21:46:31) Ural: Any video live from the cavern?
(02/06 21:46:38) Michael Engberg: You should also make it clear to her when she's around down here.
(02/06 21:46:42) Whilyam: She WILL have problems, though, if this keeps up.
(02/06 21:46:50) Whilyam: I will. I just haven't seen her much.
(02/06 21:46:53) Hu K'hanDhat: ok, we will do that ...
(02/06 21:46:55) Sorceress thanks you very much!
(02/06 21:46:57) E'nitra: oh we will!
(02/06 21:46:59) Whilyam: I'm busy myself.
(02/06 21:47:15) Marjan: But.... we have a lot to thank her for as well haven't we?
(02/06 21:47:27) Sorceress: Just remember guys, a little politeness goes a long way fi you mention this to Cate.
(02/06 21:47:29) Hu K'hanDhat: agree with yoiu Marjan
(02/06 21:47:31) Marjan: Without her funding....
(02/06 21:47:49) Michael Engberg: I do agree with you all. I may be slow on the cavern and age release, but the forum removal seems unproductive.
(02/06 21:47:51) Whilyam shrugs
(02/06 21:47:51) Whilyam: I'm glad she came. Doesn't mean shredding a good forum is okay by me.
(02/06 21:48:30) Michael Engberg: No need to be rude. Cate gets things done. But she listens... generally.
(02/06 21:49:02) Whilyam: Michael: One thing that surprised me is that you said most of these decisions end up with you being the only detractor. I would think Dr. Kodama would oppose releasing unsafe areas. Has something changed?
(02/06 21:49:08) Cosmo: hi everyone
(02/06 21:49:17) Whilyam: Shorah, Cosmo
(02/06 21:49:22) Marjan: She knows how to get a train moving ....:-)
(02/06 21:49:23) Michael Engberg: I'll be pushing from my direction. We'll see.
(02/06 21:49:27) Sorceress: Hi Cosmo
(02/06 21:49:50) Berric: can we have other avatar's head cause the one i have is not representing mine
(02/06 21:50:17) Michael Engberg: Dr. Kodama and I agree and disagree. But we seem to get along just fine.
(02/06 21:50:23) Donna: forgive me if already asked, but what is the library's status?
(02/06 21:50:44) Amrak: I am sorry, but she funds, and that's all she cares about in my
(02/06 21:50:46) Michael Engberg: Actually I was here to do a final library insprection.
(02/06 21:50:52) Donna cheers
(02/06 21:50:54) Whilyam claps his hands
(02/06 21:50:57) Hu K'hanDhat: mr. Engberg, any news on Sharper since we last met a few days ago?
(02/06 21:50:57) Sorceress claps her hands
(02/06 21:51:00) Rima cheers
(02/06 21:51:08) Myst'Aken: Need any assistance ?
(02/06 21:51:12) E'nitra: Lol
(02/06 21:51:12) Donna: opening soon then?
(02/06 21:51:18) Amrak: Sooner than friday?
(02/06 21:51:45) Michael Engberg: I don't keep up with Sharper and the rumors.
(02/06 21:51:52) Donna shivers with anitcipation
(02/06 21:51:58) Sorceress yawns
(02/06 21:52:23) Whilyam: Michael, there's been a pestering question about Watson. Do you mind if I ask you about it?
(02/06 21:52:25) Hu K'hanDhat: but, don't let us stop you from you insdpection ...
(02/06 21:52:49) Michael Engberg: Just trying to be safe on the library. I error on the cautious side. But there is a lot of pressure to open it soon.
(02/06 21:52:50) Hu K'hanDhat: We all are anxious to see the inside of the library
(02/06 21:53:08) Amrak: No pic?
(02/06 21:53:08) Sorceress: And maybe finally go down the stairs all the way!
(02/06 21:53:09) Leeh Rat (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(02/06 21:53:13) Amrak: ok then
(02/06 21:53:15) Michael Engberg: I haven't heard from Dr. Watson at all.
(02/06 21:53:43) Whilyam: Back at one of the first Town Halls, the DRC said that news about Watson should "wait until the community is healed" or something to that effect. Yet now you say we've heard nothing. What did the DRC mean by that first comment?
(02/06 21:53:49) Michael Engberg: It's a shame he's not around. He was always a voice of reason.
(02/06 21:54:20) Thumbs up from Amrak
(02/06 21:54:33) Hu K'hanDhat: and nobody in the DRC does have his most recent Mobile Phone number? Too bad
(02/06 21:54:58) Marjan: maybe he's on Yeesha's journey?
(02/06 21:55:07) Gadren: For two years?
(02/06 21:55:13) Michael Engberg: I think we were just referring to the fact that we didn't really want to spend time worrying or contemplating what might have happened.
(02/06 21:55:15) Gadren: Even I'm not that bad a puzzle-solver
(02/06 21:55:25) Marjan: Lol
(02/06 21:55:36) Prometheus: How long was Phil gone?
(02/06 21:55:42) Whilyam: Ah. Thank you. Good to have at least partial resolution to that problem.
(02/06 21:55:47) Gadren: Phil disappeared around December 2003
(02/06 21:55:55) Michael Engberg: If it's a journey, it's a long journey. I hope he's well.
(02/06 21:56:10) Sorceress: Wow, three years ago.
(02/06 21:57:06) Whilyam: I along with many others have taken a journey to free the Bahro by releasing a Tablet. Does the DRC have any info on what happened to that tablet or the Bahro? K'veer was where it was located.
(02/06 21:57:11) Berric: in the game he left message on the beginner 2004
(02/06 21:57:20) Michael Engberg: Well I'm going to do a walk-around the library area. Just my own inspection.
(02/06 21:57:39) Gadren: Don't let us get in the way
(02/06 21:57:41) Whilyam: You'll have a throng of about thirty following you, don't worry
(02/06 21:57:46) Donna: hope it goes well Michael
(02/06 21:57:52) Sorceress: Don't mind the entourage.
(02/06 21:57:57) Michael Engberg: Things have changed. We don't know what the future holds.
(02/06 21:58:01) Hu K'hanDhat: succes on that Mr. Engberg
(02/06 21:58:16) Sorceress: Does anyone?
(02/06 21:58:17) URU_Plum kneels down...
(02/06 21:58:17) URU_Plum: lead on
(02/06 21:58:38) Lobo: Donna!
(02/06 21:58:39) Michael Engberg: Thanks for chatting and letting me know your opinion. I will express you thought back to the DRC.
(02/06 21:58:41) Donna: Hi
(02/06 21:58:46) Vidar: Thank you for the Library inspection Mr. Engberg.
(02/06 21:58:50) Myst'Aken: Donna will show you the way
(02/06 21:58:57) Sorceress: Any time, Michael.
(02/06 21:59:01) Hu K'hanDhat: hope to see you around soon Mr. Engberg
(02/06 21:59:02) Michael Engberg: And I do agree with your thoughts on the forum.
(02/06 21:59:09) Berric: Thank for holding on
(02/06 21:59:12) Michael Engberg waves hello
(02/06 21:59:17) Hu K'hanDhat waves hello
(02/06 21:59:19) Marjan waves hello
(02/06 21:59:23) Donna leans left
(02/06 21:59:25) Sorceress waves hello
(02/06 21:59:26) Jack923: hello
(02/06 21:59:27) Vixen Online: Michael is it true that the DRC are using Bahro as slave labor to restore the city?
(02/06 21:59:29) Whilyam salutes
(02/06 21:59:30) Brainz waves hello
(02/06 21:59:35) E'nitra waves goodbye
(02/06 21:59:45) Gadren: Oh, by the way...we at the D'ni Network were wanting to hold some interviews with members of the DRC...could you remind the other council members to check their email?
(02/06 21:59:52) Michael Engberg: The bahro as slave labor? Ha. That's pretty good.
(02/06 22:00:11) Vixen Online: True?
(02/06 22:00:30) Gadren: Vixen, Marie Sutherland replied to such accusations by saying "To think we would means you don't understand the DRC. To think that we could means you don't understand the Bahro."
(02/06 22:00:30) Prometheus: I think that's a "no".
(02/06 22:00:30) Michael Engberg: I will remind them. Thanks for the support Gadren.
(02/06 22:00:37) Gadren: Awesome.
(02/06 22:00:39) Ekk waves nice inspection!
(02/06 22:01:06) Vixen Online: Ok
(02/06 22:01:08) Michael Engberg: If you'll excuse me.
(02/06 22:01:16) Prometheus salutes
(02/06 22:01:16) Amrak: Thx for the pics Mr. Engberg!
(02/06 22:01:21) Whilyam salutes
(02/06 22:01:22) Michael Engberg: I'll get on with things.
(02/06 22:01:28) Hu K'hanDhat steps aside for Mr. Engberg
(02/06 22:01:30) Whilyam bows
(02/06 22:01:50) dcos: shorah all, where is everyone?
(02/06 22:01:57) Sorceress: Heading toward the library
(02/06 22:02:02) Vixen Online: lol
(02/06 22:02:03) Whilyam: Michael, you could just walk off a cliff and we'd follow. Good way to clear out the City
(02/06 22:02:34) Amrak: Lol...LEMMINGS
(02/06 22:02:41) Ekk: lol
(02/06 22:02:58) dcos: oddly enough lemmings don't jump off cliffs :-P urban myth
(02/06 22:03:00) Cosmo roars with laughter
(02/06 22:03:11) dcos: started by disney of all people
(02/06 22:03:15) Whilyam: Where did these rocks come from, Michael?
(02/06 22:03:19) Amrak: Oh man, that was good dcos
(02/06 22:03:19) KL/RREN leans left
(02/06 22:03:42) KL/RREN leans right
(02/06 22:03:50) Prometheus: Haven't they always been there?
(02/06 22:04:36) Myst'Aken: I'm starting a sit in for the library
(02/06 22:04:50) Vixen Online: Sounds good
(02/06 22:04:56) Donna: me three
(02/06 22:04:58) dcos: a sit in? seriously?
(02/06 22:04:59) Vixen Online: On the black line
(02/06 22:05:36) Sorceress: Michael, do you know which King is on the mosaic on the library?
(02/06 22:05:48) KL/RREN leans right
(02/06 22:06:17) KL/RREN kneels down...
(02/06 22:06:22) Michael Engberg: Sorry I don't know which king off hand.
(02/06 22:06:41) Sorceress: Oh, okay. My guess is Kedri, but I'm not sure.
(02/06 22:07:29) Whilyam: Any news on when the Museum will open, Michael?
(02/06 22:08:27) Prometheus: This ledge seems pretty dangerous to me, Mr. Engberg.
(02/06 22:08:29) dcos: hello mister.engberg
(02/06 22:08:47) Ural: Always was...
(02/06 22:09:08) Gadren: By the way, I'm wondering...the D'ni built things to last...why is everything so broken, Mr. Engberg?
(02/06 22:09:28) Ural: Earthquakes???
(02/06 22:09:45) Whilyam: and there he went--
(02/06 22:09:53) dcos: um... did he just walk over the cliff?
(02/06 22:10:00) Whilyam: NO! Michael! You had so much to live for!
(02/06 22:10:04) KL/RREN is a bit puzzled...
(02/06 22:10:06) dcos starts to laugh
(02/06 22:10:19) dcos: did he say if he was working or just stopping by?
(02/06 22:10:26) Sorceress: He might come back, he got the Nexus link for the courtyard.
(02/06 22:10:41) Sorceress: He said he was doing final inspection for the library.
(02/06 22:10:42) dcos: he still shows as being here
(02/06 22:10:52) Whilyam: He's still here. He (OOC: hit a lag bubble)
(02/06 22:11:04) Whilyam: See?
(02/06 22:11:04) Whilyam points
(02/06 22:11:04) dcos: (k thanks )
(02/06 22:11:16) Whilyam: He's happily spinning around a blocker
(02/06 22:12:05) dcos waves hello
(02/06 22:12:09) Gadren: Sorry, I tripped on a piece of rubble back there and fell behind...was my question answered?
(02/06 22:12:21) dcos: no he's being very quiet
(02/06 22:12:32) Whilyam: en Restoration
(02/06 22:12:37) Whilyam: Zen that is
(02/06 22:12:42) dcos starts to laugh
(02/06 22:13:01) Michael Engberg: Sorry. Hard to inspect and talk at the same time.
(02/06 22:13:03) Whilyam: He'll start glowing and floating and humming and the blockers will vanish
(02/06 22:13:19) Whilyam: It's something Kodama brought with him
(02/06 22:13:31) E'nitra: would sing too if I could..
(02/06 22:13:35) dcos: sorry if we're distracting you, hows it looking?
(02/06 22:13:48) dcos is checking something out
(02/06 22:13:53) E'nitra: but my voice might damage your hearing..
(02/06 22:13:57) Hu K'hanDhat: well, you could read us a poem?
(02/06 22:14:03) Cosmo: just try, we won't hear you anyway
(02/06 22:14:19) dcos looks around for a bit
(02/06 22:14:26) Whilyam is checking something out
(02/06 22:14:30) Michael Engberg: Not too bad.
(02/06 22:14:31) Sorceress is checking something out
(02/06 22:14:35) E'nitra: i'm not that poetic Hu..
(02/06 22:14:42) Sorceress: That's good.
(02/06 22:14:46) Vixen Online: how is the inspection going Michael and please shout!
(02/06 22:14:47) dcos: Anything we can do to help?
(02/06 22:14:47) Gadren: I hope that the results of this inspection get posted on the DRC site...it would be nice if the new site was at least updated more often
(02/06 22:14:47) Whilyam: Good.
(02/06 22:15:24) Lobo: Excuse me Captain Ron, but you're sitting on me.
(02/06 22:15:32) Vixen Online: lobo and captian are snuggling
(02/06 22:15:35) Donna wonders if E'nitra will get trampled when the barriers vanish suddenly
(02/06 22:15:37) Whilyam: Nice sit in
(02/06 22:15:45) dcos: y'all still having a "sit in" ?
(02/06 22:15:54) E'nitra: I probably will Donna!
(02/06 22:16:00) Hu K'hanDhat: try something like ... one day in may i'll find a way to say ... URU is the best thing that happened to us
(02/06 22:16:05) Donna: I'll save you sweetie!!

(02/06 22:17:14) Lobo: Michael Enberg is inspecting it.
(02/06 22:17:22) Lobo: We're hoping he opens it.
(02/06 22:17:39) Whilyam: To the invisible voice: Hi

(02/06 22:18:34) Whilyam: How's it looking up here?
(02/06 22:18:52) dcos: i have the strongest urge to yell "good evening D'ni"
(02/06 22:18:58) Lobo: Just told you...
(02/06 22:19:01) E'nitra: Pff getting tired..
(02/06 22:19:02) Vixen Online: here goes the mute button
(02/06 22:19:03) dcos: we're waiting to see if mr.engberg opens the library
(02/06 22:19:03) Whilyam: Mr. Engberg is inspecting, Kalel
(02/06 22:19:06) Sorceress waves hello
(02/06 22:19:07) Brainz: donnas dancing for us
(02/06 22:19:07) Gadren: I think people are doing a "sit-in" to protest the loss of the DRC forums
(02/06 22:19:12) Michael Engberg: Seems unchanged. Just wish we understood at bit more of the reason why certain areas collapsed.
(02/06 22:19:15) Lobo: Hoping he opens it
(02/06 22:19:17) dcos cheers
(02/06 22:19:32) dcos: was there much damage mr.engberg?
(02/06 22:19:39) Whilyam: Which areas collapsed?
(02/06 22:19:43) Michael Engberg: I'll make a report.
(02/06 22:19:47) Sorceress: Was it like this when you first came to D'ni?
(02/06 22:19:56) Michael Engberg: Worse than this.
(02/06 22:20:09) Sorceress: I see. Maybe earthquakes?
(02/06 22:20:33) Vixen Online: bahro caused the collapses while protesting being used as slave labor!
(02/06 22:20:38) Michael Engberg: Just lots of debris. We've cleaned up a lot of the smaller debris.
(02/06 22:20:45) Sorceress: And didn't A'gaeris plant a bomb or twon before the Fall?
(02/06 22:20:46) Leonardo (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(02/06 22:20:51) Donna: free the Bahro!!!
(02/06 22:20:55) Gadren: See, I'm just not seeing how earthquakes could do THIS much damage...a civilization that lives underground would have been geologically knowledgable...
(02/06 22:20:59) Vixen Online: poor bahro
(02/06 22:21:17) Whilyam: You said certain areas collapsed, Michael. Any specific areas that were damaged the most?
(02/06 22:21:22) Gadren: But then again, it's not as bad when you compare it to some of the major surface disasters
(02/06 22:21:24) Michael Engberg: I'm actually surprised sometimes how little damage was done.
(02/06 22:21:26) Vixen Online: they are a proud race
(02/06 22:21:36) Donna nods her head
(02/06 22:21:58) Michael Engberg: Even small stones falling from the cavern ceiling can do quite a bit of damage.
(02/06 22:22:00) URU_Plum: damage can be cleaned up i volunteer
(02/06 22:22:00) Vixen Online: Do you like Cate Michael?
(02/06 22:22:18) Prometheus cheers
(02/06 22:22:23) Gadren: Kind of like droppiing a penny off a really tall building, Mr. Engberg?
(02/06 22:22:27) Whilyam: That's been some concern, Michael. Is the roof stable?
(02/06 22:22:33) Michael Engberg: The Guild Hall area is pretty badly damaged.
(02/06 22:22:45) Whilyam: The cavern roof that is
(02/06 22:23:07) Hu K'hanDhat: yes, we noticed a lot of hammering sounds there for quite a time now
(02/06 22:23:21) Lobo: What is the likelihood you'll be opening the library?
(02/06 22:23:26) Kelm: does that mean the Guild hall will not be open for a while?
(02/06 22:23:28) Donna: brb
(02/06 22:23:28) KAL`EL: r we going to have a cave in
(02/06 22:23:35) Michael Engberg: Right through your skull? I think that's actually not quite true - but a car sized rock can mess up a building.
(02/06 22:24:05) Vixen Online: Do some of the d'ni have active roles in the DRC, micheal?
(02/06 22:24:06) Whilyam: Is there a significant risk of that happening?
(02/06 22:24:34) Vixen Online: sorry i mean michael
(02/06 22:25:04) Michael Engberg: I won't be opening the library. But it's likely not to long now. I'll make a report.
(02/06 22:25:21) dcos: will we get to see a copy on the site?
(02/06 22:25:21) thumbs down for Amrak

(02/06 22:25:58) Gadren: I can't remember what Phase the guild hall was in...but it's nottoo far along
(02/06 22:26:03) Kelm: Micheal you mentioned the Guild Hall how long can we expect that to open
(02/06 22:26:06) Vixen Online: you said you can be bribed
