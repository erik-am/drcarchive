(02/17 01:08:09)  Firesign: i blame nolan bushnell
(02/17 01:08:14)  Dan'nee: Okay, if I keep playing like this my score is going down fast.
(02/17 01:08:18)  Dan'nee: That was too buggy for me.
(02/17 01:08:26)  LegoAddict: ahrg
(02/17 01:08:29)  Thend: I don't know who he is Fire, but I blame him as well

(02/17 01:10:16)  Thend: Yay!  I think..  I never figured out the finer points of scoring in this game
(02/17 01:10:22)  Wheely: 102
(02/17 01:10:38)  Thend: That's better than 100!
(02/17 01:10:43)  ian1: Don't worry. We all lose sometimes.
(02/17 01:10:44)  Wheely: Lol
(02/17 01:10:48)  Dan'nee: Well, pen beats book, book beats beetle, beetle beats pen.
(02/17 01:10:55)  Firesign: i lose a LOT :)
(02/17 01:10:59)  Dan'nee: Whoever has the most points on the game wins the round.
(02/17 01:11:13)  Thend: Good to hear Fire, for the next time we play
(02/17 01:11:13)  LegoAddict: i need to get back to near 150
(02/17 01:11:18)  Dan'nee: So if there's two pens, two books, and one beetle, the pens win because they beat two books.
(02/17 01:11:19)  Firesign: lol
(02/17 01:11:29)  Dan'nee: So you score one pen, then.
(02/17 01:11:41)  Dan'nee: Get 3 pens, 3 books, or 3 beetles to win.
(02/17 01:11:42) LegoAddict claps his hands

(02/17 01:12:12)  Thend: Welcome back sleepyhead!
(02/17 01:12:19)  Dan'nee: Yeah, sometimes it's hard to tell who wins so fast.
(02/17 01:12:25)  Janine: sorry bout that, I got a present :D
(02/17 01:12:31)  Thend: Oh?
