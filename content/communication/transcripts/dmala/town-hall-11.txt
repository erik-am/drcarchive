(06/20 21:55:47) DRCLVortmax1: Welcome Dr. Marie Sutherland to the Town Hall! 
(06/20 21:55:51) Legacy: :) 
(06/20 21:55:53) Cycreim: Yaaay Marie! 
(06/20 21:55:55) Dalken Starbyne: Dexploding, and unexploding are two different things. 
(06/20 21:56:02) Legacy: Hello Marie 
(06/20 21:56:03) Professor Askew: Wow, she's fast. 
(06/20 21:56:08) Ja'hesua: Greetings, Marie! 
(06/20 21:56:09) Taba: *cheers* 
(06/20 21:56:10) DRCLVortmax1: Anyone else have questions for the meeting? PM me. 
(06/20 21:56:10) Dalken Starbyne: Shorah Marie! 
(06/20 21:56:13) SuperGram: Hello Marie 
(06/20 21:56:20) Saboten: Shorah Marie 
(06/20 21:56:32) Marie Sutherland waves 
(06/20 21:56:38) Legacy: (dangit I lost my bet!, hurry somebody delay her by 15 minutes!) 
(06/20 21:56:42) DRCLVortmax1: Thanks for joining us, Dr. Sutherland. 
(06/20 21:57:16) Marie Sutherland: Good evening, everyone. 
(06/20 21:57:23) DRCLVortmax1: As we know, tonight's topic is "Ae'gura and The City" 
(06/20 21:58:20) DRCLVortmax1: Dr. Sutherland, would you like to start by telling us about the current state of the City and the Restoration? 
(06/20 21:59:57) Marie Sutherland: Things are going pretty well, I think, especially considering our current limitations. 
(06/20 22:01:21) Marie Sutherland: We are working on several areas at the moment, and are excited to be getting back to some real work. 
(06/20 22:02:21) Marie Sutherland: But we're still working at a little less than half the capacity than we were before we lost our initial funding. 
(06/20 22:02:53) Marie Sutherland: So we're trying to come up with more things like the Great Zero calibration that you explorers can help us with. 
(06/20 22:04:09) Marie Sutherland: I guess we should start with some questions. I may not know all the answers, but I'll do the best I can. 
(06/20 22:04:17) DRCLVortmax1: Dalken, you're up first! 
(06/20 22:04:23) Dalken Starbyne: Will we be seeing new parts of the City Proper in the near future...say, within the next year? 
(06/20 22:07:01) Marie Sutherland: I think so. It's hard to commit to a specific timeframe, and there are many variables that are not known at this time. But I think a year is open enough that something in the City Proper would be ready by then. 
(06/20 22:07:14) Marie Sutherland: Next question, please. 
(06/20 22:07:20) Legacy: Has Dr. Kodama been secretly moonlighting for the Hanso Foundation? I and the other explorers are desperate to know! (sorry for being off topic but this is urgent) 
(06/20 22:07:24) Legacy grins 
(06/20 22:07:29) Marie Sutherland laughs 
(06/20 22:08:06) Nyrphame Danilaise: willl international explorer licenses permit them to work on the same sites as their US colleagues? 
(06/20 22:08:19) DRCLVortmax1: Nyrph, please wait your turn. I will add you to the queue 
(06/20 22:08:28) Nyrphame Danilaise: thank you, v 
(06/20 22:08:38) Marie Sutherland: we all had to take surface jobs for awhile. I don't know what all Kodama was up to in those two years, but that is one possibility. :D 
(06/20 22:09:12) Marie Sutherland: Next question, please. 
(06/20 22:09:16) DRCLVortmax1: Cycreim 
(06/20 22:09:16) Cycreim: Can you tell us a little bit about the upper floors of the Library in Ae'gura? One of the Cyanists, I think, hinted that the DRC had been thinking of doing some restoration of that area. 
(06/20 22:09:17) DRCLVortmax1: ? 
(06/20 22:13:35) Nyrphame Danilaise: ? 
(06/20 22:13:38) GirlChair: hey 
(06/20 22:15:44) Cycreim: Oh god I broke Marie! 
(06/20 22:15:45) Legacy: We lost her 
(06/20 22:15:52) DRCLVortmax1: We lost her!! 
(06/20 22:16:17) DRCLVortmax1: Crud. I'm sure she'll be back, but she'll be chatbugged. Like me. 
(06/20 22:16:29) DRCLVortmax1: Can you hear me shouting? 
(06/20 22:16:36) Legacy: I can hear you 
(06/20 22:16:40) Cycreim: Loud and clear! 
(06/20 22:16:42) DRCLVortmax1: Okay, I'll stay then. 
(06/20 22:16:55) DRCLVortmax1: Did she give you an answer, Cycreim? 
(06/20 22:17:04) SuperGram: can you hear my shout vort? 
(06/20 22:17:08) DRCLVortmax1: Yeah 
(06/20 22:17:23) DRCLVortmax1: Actually, let me link out and back in. 
(06/20 22:18:52) Taba twitches her shawl up further to shield against the flying people bits. 
(06/20 22:18:54) Dalken Starbyne unexplodes BETTERER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
(06/20 22:19:04) Legacy is amused by the people who think they can explode betererer than her 
(06/20 22:19:17) Nyrphame Danilaise takes out a green pencil and crosses out all extra ers 
(06/20 22:19:19) Cycreim: You shouldn't have left, Vortmax! Chaos has erupted! 
(06/20 22:19:20) DRCLVortmax1: Okay, quick reminders: Please sit down, and if you have a question for Marie, PM me with "question", and I'll add you to the list 
(06/20 22:19:29) Dalken Starbyne can explode better than anyone. 
(06/20 22:19:31) Legacy can read minds, Oooo 
(06/20 22:19:45) Nyrphame Danilaise blushes having been unaware that she was standing 
(06/20 22:20:00) Resolute Guardian thinks this will be a weird looking chatlog 
(06/20 22:20:05) DRCLVortmax1: Dr. Sutherland should be rejoining us shortly 
(06/20 22:20:09) Legacy agrees 
(06/20 22:20:14) GirlChair: yessir 
(06/20 22:20:26) Nyrphame Danilaise makes anagrams of the extant chatlog - glochat 
(06/20 22:20:37) DRCLVortmax1 just hopes he won't crash more than 2 more times, as it only keeps 4 logs at a time 
(06/20 22:20:41) GirlChair: clog hat 
(06/20 22:20:43) Legacy laughs 
(06/20 22:20:50) DRCLVortmax1: Welcome back, Dr. Sutherland! 
(06/20 22:20:51) Nyrphame Danilaise: at Golch 
(06/20 22:21:05) GirlChair: THC goal 
(06/20 22:21:06) Nyrphame Danilaise shuts up 
(06/20 22:21:08) SuperGram: wb Marie 
(06/20 22:21:14) Marie Sutherland: Sincere apologies. Thanks for waiting. 
(06/20 22:21:15) GirlChair: \zips it 
(06/20 22:21:16) vid: Ah... Marie is a runner! 
(06/20 22:21:19) GirlChair: crap 
(06/20 22:21:22) GirlChair zips it 
(06/20 22:21:24) DRCLVortmax1: Did you get Cycreim's question? 
(06/20 22:21:24) Nyrphame Danilaise: go thoalc 
(06/20 22:21:43) Dalken Starbyne assures Vort that he won't have to worry....Dalken has been keeping a chatlog this whole time...and usually doesn't crash :) 
(06/20 22:21:43) Nyrphame Danilaise contemplates creating an avi named thoalc 
(06/20 22:21:51) Marie Sutherland: I'm sorry, no. I didn't see it 
(06/20 22:21:54) DRCLVortmax1: OKay folks, settle down :) 
(06/20 22:22:02) DRCLVortmax1: Cycreim, repeat please? 
(06/20 22:22:03) Nyrphame Danilaise: \me settles 
(06/20 22:22:16) Nyrphame Danilaise kicks ki 
(06/20 22:22:37) Cycreim: I don't know how closely you've been working with the Cyan employees recently but one of them hinted at possible restoration work in the library in Ae'gura. Is this true, and if so, what can you tell us about it? 
(06/20 22:24:10) Marie Sutherland: There is some work being done in the Library. We will need more space there for more Books as time goes on. 
(06/20 22:24:49) Marie Sutherland: So we are planning ahead for the future (cautious optimism). 
(06/20 22:25:01) Marie Sutherland: Next question, please. 
(06/20 22:25:05) DRCLVortmax1: Undercover Brother? 
(06/20 22:25:15) Undercover Brother: What determines which areas you are currently focusing on (i.e., Katha Island, Hood Game Room)? 
(06/20 22:26:26) Marie Sutherland: While we are understaffed, we are focusing on areas that will give explorers things to do that are repeatable. Get the most "bang for the buck", so to speak. 
(06/20 22:27:37) Marie Sutherland: Not everyone who hopefully will be joining us this fall are likely to be as patient as you all have been the last few years. 
(06/20 22:28:52) Marie Sutherland: Next question, please. 
(06/20 22:28:54) DRCLVortmax1: Vid? 
(06/20 22:29:05) vid: Dr. Sutherland, are there plans to return to using "authorized explorers" to help further the restoration, and if so will they receive any duties and benefits that those of us known as "uru explorers" will not? I remember a lot of people used to fear that seperation before the funding was lost two years ago. 
(06/20 22:30:01) Marie Sutherland: I am not sure about the answer to that right now. 

(06/20 22:30:25) Marie Sutherland: We'll have to wait and see how things work out. 
(06/20 22:30:30) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 22:30:33) DRCLVortmax1: Cycreim? 
(06/20 22:30:51) Cycreim: Speaking of ipatience, when can we get those dang doors to the Kadish art gallery opened up? :) 
(06/20 22:31:19) DRCLVortmax1 chuckles 
(06/20 22:31:25) GirlChair: are there currently any plans to open doors between places that are currently accessible to make the city more navigable? 
(06/20 22:31:51) Marie Sutherland: We're keeping those doors closed for a reason, at the moment. 
(06/20 22:32:00) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 22:32:00) From GirlChair: lol 
(06/20 22:32:08) DRCLVortmax1: GirlChair's question is next :) 
(06/20 22:32:29) GirlChair: ... 
(06/20 22:32:56) GirlChair: are there currently any plans to open doors between places that are currently accessible to make the city more navigable 
(06/20 22:33:05) GirlChair: not just kadish gallery 
(06/20 22:34:00) Marie Sutherland: Some of them may be opened at some point, but since explorers can get there (even though it's inconvenient at the moment) our priorities are elsewhere. 
(06/20 22:34:10) GirlChair: :) 
(06/20 22:34:12) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 22:34:20) DRCLVortmax1: Quick question from me: Can you give us an idea of how the explorers will be able to help out with the Restoration? 
(06/20 22:34:28) DRCLVortmax1: In the future? 
(06/20 22:34:58) Marie Sutherland: The best example right now is the Great Zero calibration. 
(06/20 22:35:27) Marie Sutherland: Things that everyone can help with simultaneously 
(06/20 22:35:46) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 22:35:48) DRCLVortmax1: Nyrphame, you're next! 
(06/20 22:36:02) Nyrphame Danilaise: we understand that international explorer licences will be handled differently this time. there is a rumour, possibly started by me, :), that we may be unable to work on projects on the same specific sites at the same time as our US colleagues - can you assure us that we will be able to? 
(06/20 22:37:16) Marie Sutherland: It is our intent to keep everyone together. If that doesn't work, we will be very disappointed. I don't know all of the details, but my understanding is that it should work out that way. 
(06/20 22:37:33) Marie Sutherland: shout next 
(06/20 22:37:40) DRCLVortmax1: vid? 
(06/20 22:37:42) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 22:37:50) vid: Many explorers have found Guildmaster Kadish's remains in his hidden vault. The DRC must be aware of him, as they've given the Gallery link in his vault a stamp of approval. Are there plans to tend to his remains, or is he meant to be left there as a marker of sorts? 
(06/20 22:38:03) DRCLVortmax1: As a reminder, if you've got a question, PM me with 'question'. I'll add you to the list. 
(06/20 22:39:11) Marie Sutherland: I'm not sure what will be done with his remains. 
(06/20 22:39:29) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 22:39:40) DRCLVortmax1: Nyrphame again! 
(06/20 22:40:02) Nyrphame Danilaise: yes, any chance of getting that medicine to help us deal with the arm paralysis issue that a lot of us have problems with down here? 
(06/20 22:41:48) Marie Sutherland: My arms work fine. I can climb ladders, open doors, pull switches, etc. If you're having problems with your arms, that might be a question to ask our friends at Cyan in another meeting. ;) 
(06/20 22:42:19) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 22:42:21) Cycreim: Marie, which area of the city are you most excited about opening up? 
(06/20 22:42:23) Nyrphame Danilaise: well it really is a cone issue - i know others have this problem - our kicks are world cup class 
(06/20 22:43:39) Marie Sutherland: That's an excellent question, Cycreim. There are so many places that I would be excited to see opened. 
(06/20 22:44:20) Marie Sutherland: Just about any place in the City Proper would be nice. 
(06/20 22:44:42) D'Neile: The Spire? 
(06/20 22:45:26) Marie Sutherland: I can't pick just one. :D 
(06/20 22:45:42) Cycreim: K'veer! 
(06/20 22:46:35) Marie Sutherland: K'veer would be nice. It is on "the list", but will not be opened for a while, I think. 
(06/20 22:46:42) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 22:46:42) DRCLVortmax1: Okay, sorry, crashed AGAIN. Uncercover Brother, I believe you were next 
(06/20 22:47:25) D'Neile needs a Hammer and Nails and a Bucket of Paint 
(06/20 22:47:36) DRCLVortmax1: Undercover Brother? 
(06/20 22:47:52) DRCLVortmax1: Going once.... 
(06/20 22:48:01) DRCLVortmax1: Okay, SuperGram? 
(06/20 22:48:44) DRCLVortmax1: Oh don't tell me we lost SG too... 
(06/20 22:48:53) SuperGram: I'm here 
(06/20 22:49:00) DRCLVortmax1: Your turn to ask Marie :) 
(06/20 22:49:14) D'Neile thinks it would be nice to open up an IMAX 
(06/20 22:49:30) SuperGram: Any chance of restoring the Concert hall and opening it up to entertain the explorers on their day off? 
(06/20 22:51:41) DRCLVortmax1: Dr. Sutherland? (Forgive me, I'm paranoid.) 
(06/20 22:52:21) Nyrphame Danilaise: poofety 
(06/20 22:52:23) Vormaen: hmmm 
(06/20 22:52:26) SuperGram: she crashed 
(06/20 22:52:29) DRCLVortmax1: Looks like I wasn't paranoid after all... 
(06/20 22:52:35) Nyrphame Danilaise: noid 
(06/20 22:52:40) Nyrphame Danilaise: pure noid :) 
(06/20 22:52:43) DRCLVortmax1: Okay, hopefully she'll come back, but we're running low on time. 
(06/20 22:52:53) DRCLVortmax1: So, I won't be taking any more questions for the queue. 
(06/20 22:53:04) SuperGram: she should sit....Less chance for crashing 
(06/20 22:53:08) Vormaen: I got a question for you Vort 
(06/20 22:53:16) DRCLVortmax1: Sure, if I can answer, I will 
(06/20 22:53:21) SuperGram: the standing avie moves.... 
(06/20 22:53:41) SuperGram: so my question is gone? 
(06/20 22:53:57) Vormaen: With all the mysteries around us, and the fact no one know anyone really, do you think people should start using their real names, to be more "U-R-U? 
(06/20 22:53:58) DRCLVortmax1: No SG, if she comes back, your question still stands :D 
(06/20 22:54:11) SuperGram: TY 
(06/20 22:54:16) Dalken Starbyne: I think he means he's not adding anyone else to the list 
(06/20 22:54:21) DRCLVortmax1: My personal opinion is no, we should be able to use what ever name we want. 
(06/20 22:54:23) SuperGram: I guess I should type it again 
(06/20 22:54:32) Vormaen: Ok 
(06/20 22:54:36) DRCLVortmax1: My surface name is available if anyone wants it, but I like using my "online" name here 
(06/20 22:54:41) DRCLVortmax1: Rather, one of my online names :) 
(06/20 22:54:47) Nyrphame Danilaise: :) 
(06/20 22:54:48) DRCLVortmax1: Marie's back on, so I think she's coming back 
(06/20 22:54:50) vid: It'd be a little awkward for the guest of honor to be sitting while addressing us, though... 
(06/20 22:55:14) Vormaen: I like the idea behind URU, and thought us being our real selves would be a neat idea 
(06/20 22:55:57) DRCLVortmax1: As a reminder, please have a seat for the meeting. 
(06/20 22:55:57) Vormaen: Hey Vort, you ever seen that Facegen program used in Oblivion? 
(06/20 22:55:59) Nyrphame Danilaise: we all shine through - nomatter what we're called :) 
(06/20 22:56:11) Nyrphame Danilaise: the ki makes me stand 
(06/20 22:56:14) DRCLVortmax1: Nope Vorm, I haven't seen it 
(06/20 22:56:17) Dalken Starbyne explodes 
(06/20 22:56:34) vid is a little uncomfortable about the careful dodge of authorized/uru explorers information 
(06/20 22:56:35) Dalken Starbyne unexplodes 
(06/20 22:56:43) Nyrphame Danilaise is pleased that DS doesn't do either betterer 
(06/20 22:56:56) DRCLVortmax1: vid, I just think they haven't planned that out fully quite yet 
(06/20 22:57:05) Dalken Starbyne does them better than anyone and everyone, however :P 
(06/20 22:57:34) Nyrphame Danilaise wonders whether DS's mother ever told him his face could freeze like this :P 
(06/20 22:57:40) DRCLVortmax1 laughs 
(06/20 22:57:42) vid: hahaha 
(06/20 22:57:44) Taba giggles 
(06/20 22:57:53) DRCLVortmax1: Okay, settle down, she's on the way back :) 
(06/20 22:57:57) vid: *explode* "Dalken! You don't want to freeze that way, now do you?!" 
(06/20 22:58:10) Nyrphame Danilaise: hahahha 
(06/20 22:58:32) DRCLVortmax1: Welcome back :) 
(06/20 22:58:44) DRCLVortmax1: Okay, SuperGram, want to ask again? 
(06/20 22:59:01) Marie Sutherland: at least I'm getting excercise... 
(06/20 22:59:06) DRCLVortmax1 chuckles 
(06/20 22:59:07) Nyrphame Danilaise: lol 
(06/20 22:59:25) Marie Sutherland: sorry about that, again. where were we? 
(06/20 22:59:33) DRCLVortmax1: I think we lost SG. I believe she wanted to know about opening the Concert Hall? 
(06/20 22:59:58) vid: opening it to explorers for events, specifically. 
(06/20 23:00:02) vid: ...er... sorry. 
(06/20 23:00:09) DRCLVortmax1: Thanks vid :) 
(06/20 23:00:37) Marie Sutherland: The Concert Hall is on "the list", but it's not at the top. It will be a while. 
(06/20 23:00:40) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 23:00:44) Undercover Brother: To what extent is the DRC aware of Yeesha and the Bahro? 
(06/20 23:01:09) Undercover Brother: As in, what's she up to? 
(06/20 23:01:24) Marie Sutherland: We know and have spoken with Yeesha. We know little about the Bahro, though. 
(06/20 23:01:53) Marie Sutherland: Ah, what is she up to? I don't know that. 
(06/20 23:02:10) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 23:02:11) DRCLVortmax1: GirlChair, you're up! 
(06/20 23:02:14) GirlChair: can we expect operational ferry boats at the dock any time in the NEAR future? :) 
(06/20 23:02:29) GirlChair: mmm water 
(06/20 23:02:40) Marie Sutherland: No, not in the near future. 
(06/20 23:02:44) GirlChair: blast 
(06/20 23:02:51) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 23:02:55) DRCLVortmax1: Vormaen? 
(06/20 23:03:50) DRCLVortmax1: Vormaen?? Are you there? 
(06/20 23:04:43) Vormaen: have you and the DRC tried to make contact with the Bahro in any way and do you expect to see more of them? 
(06/20 23:04:58) Vormaen: in the future? 
(06/20 23:06:04) Marie Sutherland: yes, we have tried to learn about the Bahro. But for some reason, it doesn't seem that they want to interact much with us. 
(06/20 23:07:09) Marie Sutherland: I wouldn't be surprised to see more Bahro around as more and more explorers complete Yeesha's initial journey. 
(06/20 23:07:29) Marie Sutherland: I do not know what effect that will have. 
(06/20 23:07:35) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 23:07:37) DRCLVortmax1: Kyven, your turn! 
(06/20 23:07:39) Kyven: Has the location of Aitrus' former home been discovered yet, and if so are there any plans to open it up for the explorers? 
(06/20 23:08:27) Marie Sutherland: we have not discovered Aitrus' home yet. That would be a very interesting find. 
(06/20 23:09:01) Marie Sutherland: If/when we find it, I would think it would be one of the things explorers would want to see. 
(06/20 23:09:17) Marie Sutherland: next 
(06/20 23:09:18) DRCLVortmax1: Finally, now that the restoration is underway again, will we get more frequent updates on the DRCsite.org website? 
(06/20 23:11:07) From GirlChair: word :) 
(06/20 23:11:11) Marie Sutherland: Yes and no. There have been several updates recently, but the website is a lower priority while we're understaffed. For instance, I typed up the updates for the Age list back at the end of april, and it took until last week to get them on the site. 
(06/20 23:11:39) DRCLVortmax1: I'd like to thank Dr. Sutherland for taking the time to talk to us tonight!
