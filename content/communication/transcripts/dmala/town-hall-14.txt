(12/19 12:32:22) Gadren: Would either of the DRC members like to make an opening statement? 
(12/19 12:32:36) Gadren: (Also, please activate /autoshout so we can all hear you)

(12/19 12:33:19) Greypiffle Fogg: Hear 
(12/19 12:33:20) Marie Sutherland: Good morning! Sorry for the last minute change of venue 
(12/19 12:33:38) Gadren: Oh, and if we could relegate chat to private messages, that would be great. :) 
(12/19 12:34:01) Marie Sutherland: We are very excited in the progress that we have been able to make this past year... 
(12/19 12:34:26) Marie Sutherland: even though much if it is hard to notice here in the cavern. 
(12/19 12:34:40) Erik: Shorah 
(12/19 12:35:23) Marie Sutherland: We are making the final preparations for opening the cavern once again 
(12/19 12:35:38) Marie Sutherland: It is a very exciting time for all of us 
(12/19 12:37:48) Marie Sutherland: Unfortunately, with the delay in getting started, our time is very short, so let's move right on to questions. 
(12/19 12:38:12) Gadren: Alright, everyone, please PM me with "QUESTION" to get on the queue. 
(12/19 12:38:17) Gadren: Arthur, you're up first 
(12/19 12:38:35) Reverend Vader: Question 
(12/19 12:38:57) Gadren: And please have your question ready to ask right as I call on you, thank you 
(12/19 12:39:32) Gadren: OK...I'm not getting a response from Arthur, so I'll move on down...Nyrph? 
(12/19 12:39:53) Nyrphame Danilaise: Can you give us some idea as to the specific dangers that we might be facing this time around -anything special we should be aware of? 
(12/19 12:40:59) Marie Sutherland: Things have changed a bit, but we wouldn't open it if we didn't think it was relatively safe. 
(12/19 12:41:12) Marie Sutherland: next 
(12/19 12:41:25) Gadren: Rev Vader, you're up 
(12/19 12:42:25) Dr. Kodama: Vader... 
(12/19 12:42:28) From Reverend Vader: scrolling... 
(12/19 12:42:44) Gadren: OK, rev vader is asking about the whereabouts of dr. watson and what his role will be in the restoration! 
(12/19 12:42:56) Gadren: he PM'ed me by accident :) 
(12/19 12:43:35) Marie Sutherland: Unfortunately, we still have not received any word from Dr. Watson. 
(12/19 12:43:56) Marie Sutherland: We still hold out hope that he will return, but there are no guarantees. 
(12/19 12:44:04) Dr. Kodama: He's probably in Maui. 
(12/19 12:44:05) Marie Sutherland: next 
(12/19 12:44:06) Gadren: L'lee, you're up next 
(12/19 12:44:11) L'lee: Does the DRC have any ETA or timetable you can give us for the reopening of the cavern and other outlying ages? 
(12/19 12:45:58) Marie Sutherland: We've continued to work behind the scenes, and the cavern will be reopened in the very near future. 
(12/19 12:46:15) Marie Sutherland: next 
(12/19 12:46:17) Gadren: Kelm asks what parts of the city you hope to focus on first 
(12/19 12:46:45) Gadren: (Heh, they're all kind of the same question ;)) 
(12/19 12:48:31) Marie Sutherland: there are some interiors that are being worked on, but there is no timeframe that's set. 
(12/19 12:48:34) From Reverend Vader: question again, if possible. :) 
(12/19 12:49:01) Gadren: Kurtis, you're up! 
(12/19 12:49:06) Kurtis: How much of a presence can we expect to see from the DRC in cavern this time around? 
(12/19 12:49:07) Marie Sutherland: We are still working with a very limited staff, so things move slowly. 
(12/19 12:49:55) Marie Sutherland: We've been working mostly behind the scenes since returning to the cavern about a year ago. 
(12/19 12:50:15) Gadren: Oh, and for those who are asking multiple questions, I'm letting others have an oppurtunity to ask first ;) 
(12/19 12:50:29) Marie Sutherland: That will be changing in the near future. 
(12/19 12:50:43) Marie Sutherland: next 
(12/19 12:50:49) Gadren: Ural? 
(12/19 12:51:13) Ural: What ages/ areas are we going to see?? 
(12/19 12:52:13) Dr. Kodama: what the... 
(12/19 12:52:14) Marie Sutherland: There won't be new Ages immediately...
