(04/07 15:22:19) Marie Sutherland: I hadn't planned on spreading any oil, darkstar. 
(04/07 15:22:44) Rand: gotta shout now, eh?
(04/07 15:23:04) darkstar: ah ok just thought you might have been aware of the dissention in some quarters as a result of the elections
(04/07 15:23:08) Marie Sutherland: Zam, we've all got blisters, but we're doing what we can with what we have.
(04/07 15:23:14) Etheldred: Shorah. Nice to meet you marie. 
(04/07 15:23:27) Cycreim: Marie, in case you didn't notice, things had been getting a bit out of hand on your forums...
(04/07 15:23:33) ireenquench: I am pleased so see you here , Marie, we have missed the DRC... we are having a hard time with the task you have for us.
(04/07 15:23:34) zam: awww poor you

(04/07 15:25:58) Etheldred waves
(04/07 15:26:00) ireenquench: I am upset because it seems we are inable to complete your task in a gracefull or peacefull manner, and I think you knew us too little to know how hard the task would be.
(04/07 15:26:10) Marie Sutherland: As long as everyone keeps it civil (which most have), things will all work out.
(04/07 15:26:11) darkstar: cya Ethy see you soon

(04/07 15:26:36) Cycreim: Later etheldred!
(04/07 15:26:55) Marie Sutherland: That's why I'm here, actually, Cycreim.

(04/07 15:27:55) Mark Dev: Eedrah.
(04/07 15:28:03) zam: That will be mid april then 
(04/07 15:28:08) darkstar: Not hanging about then
(04/07 15:28:15) ireenquench: Can you tell us now what that meeting will be about?
(04/07 15:28:16) Cycreim: So the 15th of April?
(04/07 15:28:20) Etheldred (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute): 
(04/07 15:28:27) zam: Unless we follow the people who ask to begin everything again lolol and that could be in months
(04/07 15:28:53) Cycreim: Actually yeah, that would be a good idea. It'd give us candidates a chance to canvas the Cavern with questions. (whoa, lots of hard Cs in there)
(04/07 15:29:02) darkstar: I assume tyhat'll be to sort out the ground rules?
(04/07 15:29:27) Eedrah: Wait whats going on?
(04/07 15:29:40) darkstar: and modus operandi
(04/07 15:29:50) Marie Sutherland: Yes, the 15th of April. 4:00 pm GMT (12pm Eastern/11am Central/10 Mountain/9 Pacific)
(04/07 15:30:09) ireenquench: Eedrah this is about the DRC -Explorer liaisons
(04/07 15:30:11) Eedrah: Whats going on?
(04/07 15:30:13) Cycreim: I hope I get to go. 
(04/07 15:30:24) zam: Good luck Cycreim 
(04/07 15:30:40) Marie Sutherland: Do you mind trying to get the word out?
(04/07 15:30:41) zam: And good luch to the other candiodates as well 
(04/07 15:30:49) Cycreim: A point of clarity though... we are applying for liaison positions, right? Not representatives?
(04/07 15:30:57) zam: We will spread the word out with CCN Marie
(04/07 15:31:01) Cycreim: You aren't going to ask us to keep any weird secrets, are you?
(04/07 15:31:19) ireenquench: We will get the word out about the meeting.
(04/07 15:31:23) Cycreim: And yeah I'd be a poor candidate if I didn't immediately run everywhere going 15th! 15th!
(04/07 15:31:23) Marie Sutherland: Cycreim. Yes. Liaisons. No "weird" secrets.  
(04/07 15:31:32) zam: And the Archiver
(04/07 15:31:39) Cycreim: That'll be a load off on everyone! Thanks!
(04/07 15:32:16) zam: I think some new translations job s will come soon to us ireen lolol
(04/07 15:32:22) darkstar: To uase a hackneyed expression 'the games afoot' lol
(04/07 15:32:35) Marie Sutherland: Did I miss any questions?
(04/07 15:32:37) VoiZod: lol
(04/07 15:33:01) ireenquench: I had the question what the meeting will be about...
(04/07 15:33:19) Cycreim: And I second ireen's question.
(04/07 15:33:25) darkstar: I just suggested that the first meet would set ground rules and a modus operandi
(04/07 15:34:16) Marie Sutherland: Just initiation, mainly. Getting to know the liaisons a bit, and
(04/07 15:34:16) Eedrah: i jist want know what your talking about
(04/07 15:34:20) zam: /me wish the calibration so zam will be bale to create evil markers games hehehe
(04/07 15:34:47) Jeff Klinger: This might not pertain to the topic of discussion, but how are the other members of the DRC doing?
(04/07 15:34:59) ireenquench: An initiation? Wll ther ebe a secret handshake ? Or a rite? 
(04/07 15:35:13) kimmie.: lol

(04/07 15:35:59) zam: Awwww really VoiZod?
(04/07 15:36:02) Cycreim: Say, just in passing, does Nick White still work with you guys?
