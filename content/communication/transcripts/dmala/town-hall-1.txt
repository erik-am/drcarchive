subumbra: we're an unruly crowd
Marie Sutherland: Some, but I hope to survive.
subumbra: Bye Yuki
Marie Sutherland: bye, yuki
Tweek: welcome to the Town Hall meetings everyone, thankyou for your patience. I would like to Welcome and thank Marie for agreeing to meet with the explorers. Marie all yours ^_^
Marie Sutherland: Good morning, everyone
Marie Sutherland: Thank you all for coming.
Marie Sutherland: I guess I'll start by telling you a little about myself.
Marie Sutherland: I've been with the DRC since 1993.
Marie Sutherland: and an official member of the council since '97.
Marie Sutherland: Back when the restoration was going full time, I oversaw phases 3 and 5
Ivan: Any information you're willing to devulge about Blake? Is he satisfied with the number of explorers?
Marie Sutherland: Hopefully we're close.
Marie Sutherland: I don't think he's looking for a specific number, though.
Marie Sutherland: We'll try to give you news about that when we have it. Next question.
Janina: As an anthropologist, did you also study the civilizations that are/were native to the Ages? If yes, are we going to see any info on them?
Marie Sutherland: We have primarily focused on making the Ages safe for explorers. We do
Marie Sutherland: occasionally learn a bit about the natives in the course of that, but we haven't made that our focus.
Marie Sutherland: I would like that to change over time, if the restoration returns full time.
Vormaen: I wanted to know, about Dr. Watson and if you do not want to answer, maybe why the unwillingness to speak about such an important part of the DRC?
Marie Sutherland: Unfortunately, I don't have any information to give about Dr. Watson. I haven't seen or heard from him for two years.
Chris Burnham: What is the timeline for new DRC programs such as ages, or whatever is else is coming?
Marie Sutherland: That highly depends on funding. We'll probably focus on Ages that can be restored more quickly
Marie Sutherland: while the restoration is ramping up again.
Marie Sutherland: Sorry that time is so short. Thanks again for coming.
Marie Sutherland: these town hall meetings will get better as we get the hang of them.
