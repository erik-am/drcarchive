ZalionXI: Nice to meet you Victor :D
Victor Laxman: i understand i'm competing with Dr. K - that's a tough act to go up against :) i hope he has some hecklers :)
Janina: Sorry I'm late!
Eleri: we're running on Bahro time, evidently :)
Victor Laxman: this is a rather interesting forum - hope this works well so we can do it again
zammie: yes that is great to be able to meet :)
Victor Laxman: yes - now this is the Italian neighborhood - i take it most of you are from Italy?
Janina: No, most italians are following via real tim translation on the Neighbors chat. Victor, may I get a picture of you for our forum?
Victor Laxman: of course Janina - I'd be honored
Janina: thank you!
CAGrayWolf: Welcome everyone. Please have a seat and we will begin soon.
Victor Laxman: hello CAGrayWolf - pleasure to see you
CAGrayWolf: Shorh Victor good to see you as well.
Sam Byard: whats the topic
CAGrayWolf: The topic is about Victor. His views, background, ideas, etc
Victor Laxman: i like that topic :)
zammie: I wonder why
CAGrayWolf: Please bear with me as I'm running this one alone. Victor, are you ready to begin?
Victor Laxman: fire away - whatever you need to know about me :)
Victor Laxman: my life is an open book - so to speak
Sam Byard: Before the cavern's closure you were working on the KI. Is there any work you are currently planning to bring out which concerns the KI ?
Sam Byard: e.g. marker updates etc.
Victor Laxman: good question - i continue to work on the KI as I find time...
Victor Laxman: i would like to implement a few features but they're pending our ability to get some additional resources
Victor Laxman: (and fix a few problems)
zammie: doest it mean we will be able to create our own evil marker games soon?
Victor Laxman: that is high on my list - i think it's important (and fun) to get that features fixed and working...
Victor Laxman: as soon as possible.
Victor Laxman: (it's one of my pet projects actually.)
Victor Laxman: next please
Janina: Are, or were, there any plans about collaborative efforts with the explorers, like the calibrating of the Great Zero?
Victor Laxman: the great zero calibration is still pending - i think we need a bit more accuracy - but there are other...
Victor Laxman: collaborative efforts as well - like the lake light for example
Myridean: Hello Victor, thanks for coming, my question is in regard to the Nexus restoration, how difficult was it to get it working again after all those years of remaining dormant in the cavern?
Victor Laxman: Actually surprisingly easy to restore it once we figured out what it was...
Victor Laxman: the part that took the longest was actually using it for the first time...
Victor Laxman: because that can always be a potentially life-threatening experience
Victor Laxman: First links are always taken very cautiously
Sam Byard: have you or any of you team made any effort to contact the absent restoration members such as Dr. Watson and Sharper ?
Victor Laxman: We always remain vigilant in our efforts to stay in contact with anyone who...
Victor Laxman: was here before. Anyone who helped previously can always help again...
Victor Laxman: Dr. Watson remains out of the picture at this point. A pity if you ask me.
Janina: Could you tell us a little about how you came in contact with the DRC? Janina: how was your experience in discovering the Cavern, the Books etc.
Victor Laxman: of course. I actually learned of the DRC from Dr. Watson in 1995 - actually learned of D'ni then...
Victor Laxman: and joined the effort a couple years after that
Victor Laxman: hard for me to believe it's been ten years
Victor Laxman: my first experience was the journey down with Dr. Watson. And I must say...
Victor Laxman: it was the most exciting thing I've been involved in. That initial trek down was...
Victor Laxman: a highlight of my life. (Well, next to my divorce.) :)
Victor Laxman: (A bit of humor - sorry)
Sam Byard: i was wondering as you mentioned a collaborative effort to restore light to the cavern. Will we see that soon? If so how soon?
Victor Laxman: it's a tricky thing - we're still examining the organism that produces the light to make sure we...
Victor Laxman: don't damage it while we think we're helping. The best approach for us is to see what...
Victor Laxman: the D'ni themselves did and try to follow their lead. That's what we're doing in this case.
Myridean: Victor, have you been to Eder Delin yet? And if so, can you remember if the design on its book's spine is similar to the linking books for Kemo and Gira by any chance?
Victor Laxman: as a matter of fact the spine was very similar to Eder Kemo.
Victor Laxman: we tend to think they are cut from the same cloth - so to speak
CAGrayWolf: Victor, have you taken the Journey and what are your views of this and how does this affect your views of the restoration of the Cavern?
Victor Laxman: and as for the journey - yes I've embrace the Journey and it has changed my way of thinking...
Victor Laxman: ... not to mention given me a home age and a quick way out of sticky situations. :)
Victor Laxman: Yeesha spoke of things that we are all still trying to fully grasp - but it feels right to be trying...
Victor Laxman: instead of ignoring her.
CAGrayWolf: What are your personal goals for the Cavern. What would you presonally like to see happen?
Victor Laxman: I would like more places to be restored for you all to explore
Victor Laxman: it's frustrating for us to see the potential and yet have so little at our disposal to make it available...
Victor Laxman: here's hoping that we all get that chance!
Sam Byard: Is Eder Delin safe and if so when will the linking book come avaliable to us ?
Sam Byard: or will it at all ? !
Victor Laxman: It's my opinion that it is very safe - and I would expect it would be one of the first places...
Victor Laxman: if we can get "sponsored"
Victor Laxman: but it is a very small place - actually small group that we found...
Victor Laxman: but very beautiful.
Victor Laxman: seems time is running out
Victor Laxman: thank you all for supporting our effort
