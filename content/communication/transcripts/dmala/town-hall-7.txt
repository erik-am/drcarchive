CAGrayWolf: Dr Kodama, is there anything you would like to tell us about yourself first?
Dr. Kodama: Not especially.
Janine: I had earlier heard in another meeting with M/shout First let me thank you Kodama for all the work you and the others are doing, I know it is hard and we appreciate it all. My question is what more can we the players do to assist/help you to gain your funding?
Dr. Kodama: I'm not sure I have an answer that would be satisfying. Not much. You are here and that's what we need. The more the better. But, even that doesn't guarantee
Dr. Kodama: our funding.
Dr. Kodama: As I said in the last meeting, I try to stay out of our funding.
Dr. Kodama: I will work on Ages until I'm told I can't anymore.
Andrew_C: assumin that funding is achieved, what areas of the Cavern are likely to be opened next? eg, areas of Aegura, K'Veer, the City Proper?
Dr. Kodama: The City Proper is a ways out. There are many issues.
Dr. Kodama: There have been a few new Ages, recently talked about in our meetings, that might move to the front.
Dr. Kodama: We are still in discussions, as to what we are able to release, given our resources, and what would best serve the people here.
Dr. Kodama: Your input is important. We do value it.
Dr. Kodama: So, the short answer is, I'm not sure.
Dr. Kodama: Not what you wanted to here, but the truth.
Underwaterfall: Dr, what has been your favorite project that you have worked on, or are working on?
Dr. Kodama: Rebek and the Age of Pento.
Dr. Kodama: Rebek is incredible - very diverse, beautiful, and filled with much to do.
Dr. Kodama: Pento is the site of the Pento War - I do enjoy history - and is also an amazing place.
Dr. Kodama: Both are fantastic.
Janine: Bama asks Have you or do you ever anticipate comeing across any living D'ni in the ages you explore?
Dr. Kodama: We have and I anticipate it happening again
CAGrayWolf: Dr Kodama ... have you taken 'Teh Journey" and if you have how has this affected your views towards the restoration of D'ni?
Dr. Kodama: I have taken the journey - as I said in our last meeting, I'm not sure it affected my views that profoundly.
Dr. Kodama: I always have and still want to restore this place.
Dr. Kodama: Is there more you were looking for? I've been asked that before.
walt: are there any ages under exploration by DRC that may be opened to us in the future?
Dr. Kodama: Yes. We hope that all of them will be opened at some point in the future. It's just a matter of when.
Underwaterfall: What do you want the most from this endeavor - what single item, if any would you like to accomplish or goal to reach?
Dr. Kodama: I would like this place to live again.
Dr. Kodama: As it once did.
Dr. Kodama: With numerous Ages and broad experiences for all who visit.
Whilyam: How many explorers will it take to calibrate the GZ, Dr? I know Laxman was working in the GZ and would know more, but I crashed out of his meeting before I could ask him.
Dr. Kodama: I'm not sure any of us know exact numbers. Laxman might but I've never heard it. A lot.
Nommie: yes, hello doctor, I was wondering how you account for the inter age operatability of the KI
Dr. Kodama: Not sure what you mean by that.
Nommie: sending messages between the Ages.
Dr. Kodama: D'ni technology.
Dr. Kodama: No other explanation.
TheFourthDoctor: the question was, have you or anyone else in the DRC ever discovered the Book of Gemedet? It might be interesting to see the sort of age that Aitrus and Ti'ana created knowing that Ti'ana was not D'ni.
Dr. Kodama: I personally have not been there.
Dr. Kodama: Sorry.
Underwaterfall: Based ib what you know of the bahro, what do you think about them? How might they affect the restoration?
Dr. Kodama: I know very little about them - but what I do know, they very well may, and probably will, affect the restoration at some level or another. 
Kiteerah: Have you found any new journals that we might see in the near future?
Dr. Kodama: Lots of new journals.
Dr. Kodama: Too many to translate.
Dahn: Dr. Kodama, have you ever taken it upon yourself to learn 'the art' of age writing? If so, are we explorers likely to ever visit these ages if deemed safe?
Dr. Kodama: I have not learned "The Art".
Dr. Kodama: I have plenty of Ages to restore without writing new Ages.
Dr. Kodama: Not to say the Art can't be learned, I'm just not interested myself.
Artemesia: How exactly does Age restoration take place?
Dr. Kodama: We have five phases of restoration beginnign with early structural work and ending with final safety tests, etc.. Dr. Kodama: Most of us are in charge of some form of that effort or another overseeing teams, small teams right now, who help us carry out the work.
