CAGrayWolf: What are the curent DRC plans for the cavern?
Michael Engberg: first, try and get funding so we can actually do something...
Michael Engberg: right now with limited funding we don't have the resources to fully restore things...
Michael Engberg: were here for the same reason you are... we feel called :)
Julian Lapis: Ok. It was hinted in the first liason meeting that some of you had taken the Journey. Is this something you've done? Has it changed your views of the restoration in any way?
Michael Engberg: after some risistance i did take the journey...
Michael Engberg: and it has changed my views...
Michael Engberg: I think I understood the brains of d'ni but not the heart... until i took the journey , next question.
Sam Byard: Hi Michael, I was talking to Wheely a few weeks ago and she said that you had been working on an age called Kahlo. What is your job in this particular restoration and what does it entail.
Michael Engberg: Kahlo is an age that we have been looking at for along time...
Michael Engberg: However, its my job to determain if some of the odd structures are safe..
Michael Engberg: and let me tell you there are some odd structures :)
Eleri: If I may sneak in here, MIchael, what is your job with the DRC, just so we all know?
Michael Engberg: Oh good question I'm a structural architect by training.. Zymmin asked about funding
Michael Engberg: with the money from the foundation no longer availible...
Michael Engberg: we are on our own...
Michael Engberg: and for now.. just being here .. helps tremendously
Ti'chelle: Michael, can you explain what you mean by odd structures? Are there structures you do not understand how to repair? 
Michael Engberg: ya thats an understatement.
Michael Engberg: the structures there don't appear to be man-made...
Michael Engberg: so working with them presents some unique problems..
Michael Engberg: in fact theres little ( if anything ) man-made in kahlo. strange place.
Sam Byard: you mentioned you were a structural engineer/architect I was wondering where you recieved your training and what aspect of the restoration you enjoy the most?si/sit
Michael Engberg: USC... Masters of Building Science...
Michael Engberg: my favorite part, even though its dangerous, is the first trip to an age.
Michael Engberg: btw if you see my daughter.. please be nice :)
Lial: /will we be able to explore with MacOS?
Michael Engberg: (two words - boot camp) :)
CAGrayWolf: Michael, since you have taken the Journey ... what are your personal views for the Cavern? What would you like to see happen?
Michael Engberg: i'd like nothing more than to have some way to open up more and more...
Michael Engberg: of the cavern and ages for you to explore. That's what we all want...
Michael Engberg: and we seem like we've got a small chance at seeing that happen (cautious optimism)
Michael Engberg: :)
