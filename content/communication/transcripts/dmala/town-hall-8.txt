Eleri: Victor, would you like to introduce yourself?
Victor Laxman: i first wanted to thank eleri, vortmax, and the other liasons for organizing and handling these town hall meetings.
Victor Laxman: it's been great to share a bit about us with the everyone...
Victor Laxman: So, let's see... I'm Victor Laxman (as you know)... uh...
Victor Laxman: ... i'm 47?... yeah 47 (48 in June)
Victor Laxman: i know i don't look a day over 30, right?
Victor Laxman: okay maybe 35
Victor Laxman: ready for questions - seems to be a few
Zymmin: Victor, sorry to be so bold. If i remember correctly there was a rift between you and Dr. Watson. Have you spoke with him lately? Will he be working in D'ni again anytime soon?
Victor Laxman: i have not spoken with him in a long time - but I feel like things were fine between us before...
Victor Laxman: he left. Other than he just left us hanging. But we do understand that he was looking...
Victor Laxman: for something. Just like we all are.
subumbra: Victor, How does being involved in something so extraordinary effect your personal life? It must be rather strange to have to explain what you do to "outsiders"
Victor Laxman: Personal life? What's that? Seriously I have no time to persue leisure activities. It's just me...
Victor Laxman: down here in the Cavern exploring everything it has to offer.
Victor Laxman: when needed i do tell people exactly what i'm doing - although i think many don't believe me.
Gondar: Have you or the rest of the team found any other D'ni 'computerlike' technoligy? We have the KI and GZ, and the heek table.. anything you're fixing up right now, or plan to when funding comes?
Victor Laxman: there are all kinds of "computer-like" devices, but most of them seem to be for specific tasks...
Victor Laxman: We're trying to spend our time on the more general equipment like the KI's, the GZ, and the Nexus related items. 
Kaelri: What was your first reaction to D'ni? Your first thoughts? Anything that intrigued you in particular?
Victor Laxman: The journey is what amazed me because at every turn I found something better...
Victor Laxman: until finally arrivingt in the cavern and seeing the lake and city for the first time. Simply awesome.
Victor Laxman: i continue to be amazed at the size of the place, by the way - both in the cavern and the ages beyond
Vortmax2: It seems Whilyam crashed. But he wanted to know if you had any idea how many explorers it would take to calibrate the Great Zero.
Victor Laxman: i don't know a number, and i'm not sure that it's ever calibrated...
Victor Laxman: ... i think it's just more and more accurate with every entry. At some point we reach a level of diminishing returns...
Victor Laxman: and we call it good!
Eedrah: what was it like when you started?
Victor Laxman: quiet - very quiet! And exciting - it was actually quite special to run into anyone in those days...
Victor Laxman: ... not many people around.
Victor Laxman: much more interesting now - with more people - seems more appropriate
joao pedro: was there any Age that you found particullarly difficult to work on. if so, which one and why.
Victor Laxman: Ae'gura was very difficult - just because of the size and magnitude of the destruction. A lot of ...
Victor Laxman: ... manual labor to get things ready for more people.
Bobbie: Are the DRC planning to open more areas of the City?
Victor Laxman: i think so - as much as possible. There are a few buildings and districts that are in not...
Victor Laxman: too bad of shape. Those would be first. The City Proper is amazing, but has extensive damage...
Victor Laxman: and requires quite a bit of time and resources.
Kaelri: Is there any one project of yours left in the cavern - or the Ages, of course - that you would most like to see to completion?
Victor Laxman: It's hard for me to pick one. But I would love to make the City Proper grand once again. It just seems like... 
Victor Laxman: ... such a monumental task. One the age side, I would love to explore more of Gira myself...
Victor Laxman: ... I'm afraid I haven't gotten much beyond the limits, but it looks amazing.
Eleri: Victor, to wrap up, are there any ages you've read about, or unexplored books you've found, that you're really curious about?
Victor Laxman: Rebek is both beautiful and exciting - would be fun to get that one going - partially because...
Victor Laxman: I would like to know the history behind what went on there. Bound to be an interesting story.
Thend: What do you believe is the ultimate purpose of calibrating Great Zero, and what are it's functions, based on your observations?
Victor Laxman: It seems to be simply a grand marker for the D'ni. Without a frame of reference to base things on...
Victor Laxman: ... (like stars, sun, magnetic directions) they simply created one.
Victor Laxman: when they arrived.
joao pedro: victor, didn't you say that you had taken the journey. if so, why don't you have a Relto book.
Victor Laxman: I do have one - hidden under my suave black outfit.
