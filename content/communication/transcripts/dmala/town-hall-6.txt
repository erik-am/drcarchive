Eleri: So, without further fuss, I'll hand it over to Michael. Why don't you tell us a bit about yourself?
Michael Engberg: Ok... 
Michael Engberg: thanks for having me .. i'm michael Engberg 
Michael Engberg: I'm 39 years old..
Michael Engberg: my first trip to D'ni was in 1998
Michael Engberg: How was that?? 
Professor Askew: Michael, can you elaborate on the Lake project that was mentioned in an earlier meeting? What might it entail? 
Michael Engberg: If its with regard to the lake light? umm... Its something victor is looking into... 
Michael Engberg: the light levels of the lake.. are on the low side and we are looking in to how to raise them. 
Marcello: Which project where you most interested in of taking up again after Victor contacted you? And r u indeed working on it? 
Michael Engberg: I like the Eders (gardens).. i'm kinda quite by nature so i always enjoy my time there.. 
Ural: iheard you were working on kahlo, how is it comg? 
Michael Engberg: My work on kahlo continues.. only because there is so much work to be done there... 
Michael Engberg: the odd structures there have been diffucult for me to analyze
Michael Engberg: bone-like structures , but almost made of a rocklike material.
Gondar: In your job down here, do you just check if the structures are safe (and cordon off), or do you do actual repair work too? Perhaps using stone-tricks learned from the D'ni? 
Michael Engberg: Everybody wears lots of hats done here... 
Michael Engberg: my expertise is in Analysis, but repairing is something we all find ourselves doing... 
Michael Engberg: we use tools we are familar with for the most part.. D'ni tools when required. 
subumbra: Michael, how many people are currently in the DRC and what kind of resources do you now have at your disposal, prior to further financing?
Michael Engberg: 4 of us primarly.. with a few extra helpers.,. 
Michael Engberg: our resources are very limited, we are on a week by week basis, but we are committed to do as much as we can do.. 
Marcello: considering the restricted financing which tasks are you concentrating on, are having high priority? 
Michael Engberg: focusing on places that don't require much work.. they may be simple.. but at least then we can get them done.. 
JaredWhite: Assuming further funding, are there any plans to expand the areas we can explore in Ae'gura? 
Michael Engberg: J'taeri, numerous smaller sites, and long term city proper.... 
Thend: In calibrating Great Zero, what do you hope is accomplished? What function would it ultimately serve, according to your own observations? 
Michael Engberg: That is laxman's area.. what i want is to not be lost
Someone (possibly Eleri): Michael, quick side question: Myself and others of the Great Tree have been wondering whether any member of the DRC has any knowledge of where Douglas Sharper might have stored our GT jackets.
Michael Engberg: Sharper is a private guy.. where ever he stored them I bet they are very well hidden
Michael Engberg: i'll look for them if you want?
Tink: Gonna ask a change of pace . . . sorta. You having fun down here now? Have an anecdote to share?
Michael Engberg: its fun having Wheely down here.. family is very important to me.
Marcello: Have you gained any knowledge (that might be shared in the near future) on actually writing ages?
Michael Engberg: wow great question...
Michael Engberg: yes gained knowledge.. no can't share...
Michael Engberg: at this time.. 
subumbra: What is the DRC stance on the Bahro? There seem to be a lot of them around.
Michael Engberg: as much as we have learned about the Bahro it feels like we don't know anything..
Michael Engberg: very mysterious
Eleri: I have a question to wrap up: What was your reaction to learning there was an underground civilization? And what was your first link like?
Michael Engberg: my reaction was much like yours...
Michael Engberg: finding an underground civilization was a highlight in my life..
Michael Engberg: linking was terrifying and invigorating at the same time:)
Michael Engberg: .. it still is
