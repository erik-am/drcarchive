(06/14 08:12:25) Victor Laxman waves 
(06/14 08:12:29) CAGrayWolf: Shorah Mr Laxman. 
(06/14 08:12:29) vid: oh dear.... Victor's KI is chatbugged... 
(06/14 08:12:34) Ashem waves 
(06/14 08:12:45) Victor Laxman: sorry I'm late - terrible traffic :) 
(06/14 08:12:49) DRCLeri1: G'morning! 
(06/14 08:12:54) vid: we can hear him... but he can't hear us... 
(06/14 08:13:05) GingerDiva: rut roh 
(06/14 08:13:10) Victor Laxman: Shall we get started? 
(06/14 08:13:12) To DRCLeri1: No hotspot for Laxman 
(06/14 08:13:15) From DRCLeri1: did you tell him? 
(06/14 08:13:27) To DRCLeri1: No 
(06/14 08:13:52) From DRCLeri1: got it :) 
(06/14 08:13:54) Swimmery4: well, if we have to :) 
(06/14 08:14:38) Victor Laxman: Well I'm ready to answer your questions. Thanks for the opportunity. 
(06/14 08:14:43) DRCLeri1: lets see if we can't get him all the way here:) 
(06/14 08:14:44) CAGrayWolf: I would like to welcome our guest speaking this morning Mr Victor Laxman. 
(06/14 08:14:52) DRCLeri1 claps her hands 
(06/14 08:14:58) Victor Laxman waves 
(06/14 08:14:58) GingerDiva claps her hands 
(06/14 08:15:02) Kimmie claps her hands 
(06/14 08:15:03) vid claps his hands 
(06/14 08:15:09) Ural claps his hands 
(06/14 08:15:11) Daniel Timberwood claps his hands 
(06/14 08:15:22) Nikolas claps his hands 
(06/14 08:15:34) From DRCLeri1: dunno if he heard me, though 
(06/14 08:15:48) To DRCLeri1: Did he get presubmitted questions or are we opening the floor? 
(06/14 08:16:17) From DRCLeri1: trying to find out... 
(06/14 08:16:48) vid coughs 
(06/14 08:17:09) CAGrayWolf: Please be patient ... we are having some technical difficulties. 
(06/14 08:17:13) From DRCLeri1: this could get...interesting... 
(06/14 08:17:13) Victor Laxman: Certainly... 
(06/14 08:17:31) Victor Laxman: I hope everyone can hear me... 
(06/14 08:17:36) vid is just paranoid of getting forcibly linked again 
(06/14 08:17:41) Swimmery4: yes 
(06/14 08:17:54) GingerDiva: yes Victor, we hear you :) 
(06/14 08:18:20) Victor Laxman: The D'ni technology is intriguing, not like the electronics we're used to... 
(06/14 08:19:26) Victor Laxman: And their processing equipment is not based on binary like our computers... 
(06/14 08:20:06) Victor Laxman: So we've had to try to start from "square one" with regard to figuring out how things work around here. 
(06/14 08:20:06) vid: Hm... a five digital processing system, instead of two? 
(06/14 08:20:16) Victor Laxman: First the KI... 
(06/14 08:20:23) From DRCLeri1 in DRCLeri1's Relto: crashed to desktop, grr 
(06/14 08:20:48) Victor Laxman: Seems the majority of processing that takes place is not in the KI itself... 
(06/14 08:21:40) Victor Laxman: ...but in the primary lattice array. Very interesting because it allows... 
(06/14 08:22:03) Victor Laxman: for a very flexible system. It can be changed and upgraded on the fly. 
(06/14 08:22:35) From DRCLeri1: how goes? 
(06/14 08:23:04) To DRCLeri1: Fine so far. You're not on the list anymore. 
(06/14 08:23:14) Victor Laxman: The GZ itself was apparently not originally linked to the KI... 
(06/14 08:23:20) From DRCLeri1: let me try again 
(06/14 08:23:39) Victor Laxman: It was added as an upgrade later. 
(06/14 08:24:15) Victor Laxman: I could go on and on about this stuff. Do you have specific questions so I don't bore you with my rambling? 
(06/14 08:24:31) To DRCLeri1: Oh and I upgraded my DSL. Now running at 6.0 Mbps downstream. How about making the hood public? 
(06/14 08:24:58) From vid: question 
(06/14 08:25:05) CAGrayWolf: Vid? 
(06/14 08:25:39) CAGrayWolf: Sorry, forgot to shout. Vid you have a qustion? 
(06/14 08:26:03) vid: Mister Laxman... first off, I'd like to wish you a happy birthday. But I do have a question.... if the KI was not yet distributed throughout the D'ni populous, how large was the risk of someone being trapped in the Nexus? 
(06/14 08:27:00) To DRCLeri1: Did you make the hood public? 
(06/14 08:27:15) From DRCLeri1: nope, let someone in who'd crashed 
(06/14 08:27:34) From DRCLeri1: how am I now? 
(06/14 08:27:34) Victor Laxman: Great question. From what we've seen that actually was part of the plan... 
(06/14 08:28:06) To DRCLeri1: OK. Just watched quite a few drop from the list. 
(06/14 08:28:07) Victor Laxman: The elite members of society who had access to KIs could move freely... 
(06/14 08:28:10) From DRCLeri1: trapping somoene in Nexus was part of the plan?! 
(06/14 08:28:46) From DRCLeri1: I'm letting people back in as the pm me :) 
(06/14 08:28:47) Victor Laxman: But anyone without a KI would be entrapped - providing a certain level of protection for the... 
(06/14 08:29:05) To DRCLeri1: Ahh ok. 
(06/14 08:29:13) Victor Laxman: upper eschelon. We assume that the Nexus was monitored back then and... 
(06/14 08:29:26) From Arthur Kalnins: QUESTION 
(06/14 08:29:42) Victor Laxman: those who were trapped were fined and released. But we're not sure on that point. 
(06/14 08:29:50) Victor Laxman: Next question? 
(06/14 08:29:52) From DRCLeri1: cool! 
(06/14 08:29:54) CAGrayWolf: Arthur, you have a question? 
(06/14 08:30:15) From DRCLeri1: I cqan't wait to see the log of what I missed 
(06/14 08:30:29) Arthur Kalnins: Back when the first Restoration was going on, the "private rooms" in the hoods were shown to block outside KI signals. Could you explain why you were hesitant to open those areas? Was it because of the restriction on KI traffic? 
(06/14 08:31:46) Victor Laxman: We were only hesitant because we weren't sure if the blocked KI signal was... 
(06/14 08:32:27) From DRCLeri1: question 
(06/14 08:32:36) To DRCLeri1: They're dropping like flies. 
(06/14 08:33:04) From DRCLeri1: it's a cranky morning. Wonder why 
(06/14 08:33:26) From DRCLeri1: I'll go reopen the hood. 
(06/14 08:33:32) To DRCLeri1: Cool 
(06/14 08:34:38) CAGrayWolf: I think we may have lost Victor ... 
(06/14 08:34:41) Arthur Kalnins: Yep 
(06/14 08:34:54) Arthur Kalnins: His KI's malfunctioning 
(06/14 08:35:15) vid: poor guy... the lattice is really wailing on him. I think it's giving him his birthday licks. 
(06/14 08:35:17) GingerDiva: that revolting lattice again 
(06/14 08:35:29) Nikolas sighs 
(06/14 08:35:30) CAGrayWolf: Eleri has also gone to make the hood public since so many seemed to have crashed out. 
(06/14 08:35:34) Jacuru: and many more as shown on age players there is even a ghost around 
(06/14 08:35:39) Kimmie sighs... 
(06/14 08:35:42) Arthur Kalnins: Yes. I blame it all on revolting lettuce 
(06/14 08:36:01) Swimmery4: are there any plans for Windows: Lattice Edition? :) 
(06/14 08:36:08) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh 
(06/14 08:36:16) Arthur Kalnins: Zoom! Off goes Victor! Super Laxman! 
(06/14 08:36:42) CAGrayWolf: WB Victor 
(06/14 08:36:51) Arthur Kalnins: My KI doesn't show you, Mr. Laxman 
(06/14 08:36:59) vid: nor does mine... 
(06/14 08:37:05) Daniel Timberwood: or mine 
(06/14 08:37:06) Kimmie: nor mine... 
(06/14 08:37:09) Swimmery4: mine doesn't show half the people here 
(06/14 08:37:10) GingerDiva: still chatbugged? 
(06/14 08:37:11) Victor Laxman: I'm very sorry - must have triggered some lattice field anomaly - or something. :) 
(06/14 08:37:22) Arthur Kalnins: Oops. Hear you fine, though. 
(06/14 08:37:25) vid gently taps his KI against the rock 
(06/14 08:37:39) Victor Laxman: I was discussing the delayed approval of the private rooms. 
(06/14 08:37:44) Swimmery4 is more viscous with his KI :) 
(06/14 08:37:58) CAGrayWolf: Correct Mr Laxman. 
(06/14 08:38:02) vid: if he's not on the age list, it usually means we can hear him, but he can't hear us... oops *shuts up* 
(06/14 08:38:13) Victor Laxman: We were hesitant to approve the use of the areas until we understood... 
(06/14 08:38:48) Victor Laxman: if the KI shielding was intentional or accidental... 
(06/14 08:39:36) Victor Laxman: Accidental phenomenon like that may have had dangerous side effects... 
(06/14 08:40:01) Victor Laxman: And we were also a bit worried about the floating egg. :) 
(06/14 08:40:16) Victor Laxman: Next question? 
(06/14 08:40:29) CAGrayWolf: Eleri, you had a question? 
(06/14 08:40:56) From vid: question (if it's ok for a second one when there's an opening) 
(06/14 08:40:57) From Arthur Kalnins: QUESTION 
(06/14 08:41:03) DRCLeri1: Do you know how the KI dispensers work? 
(06/14 08:41:34) Victor Laxman: It dispenses KIs... :) 
(06/14 08:41:39) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh 
(06/14 08:41:43) GingerDiva starts to laugh 
(06/14 08:41:47) Victor Laxman: It has two functions actually... 
(06/14 08:41:49) Erik laughs 
(06/14 08:42:27) Victor Laxman: First it physically attaches the KI to hands... 
(06/14 08:43:07) Victor Laxman: Second - it registers it with the primary lattice to provide the correct level of functionality. 
(06/14 08:43:16) To vid: I'd like to ask a ?? and then you'll be next. 
(06/14 08:43:20) Victor Laxman: Next? 
(06/14 08:43:29) CAGrayWolf: I have a ??? 
(06/14 08:43:45) From DRCLeri1: question, when it gets back around to me 
(06/14 08:44:21) CAGrayWolf: Several explorers have asked if the KI will be translated to any other languages, specifically Spanish? 
(06/14 08:44:39) From GingerDiva: question 
(06/14 08:45:37) Victor Laxman: Our initial work (lots of it) was just to provide a base level of functionality in english... 
(06/14 08:46:14) Victor Laxman: It's just a matter of juggling resources at this point... 
(06/14 08:47:01) Victor Laxman: We've been focusing on linking effects lately - and how the lattice, KI, and books work together. 
(06/14 08:47:36) From Arthur Kalnins: QUESTION... if I live so long. 
(06/14 08:47:40) Victor Laxman: We're trying to make some improvements - optimize certain aspects of linking, if you will. 
(06/14 08:48:15) Victor Laxman: To answer the question directily - once we are not stretched quite so thin, we would like to... 
(06/14 08:48:25) Victor Laxman: add other languages. 
(06/14 08:48:34) Victor Laxman: next? 
(06/14 08:48:36) CAGrayWolf: Vid, you have a question? 
(06/14 08:48:57) vid: yes, is this coming through? 
(06/14 08:49:11) CAGrayWolf: I hear you Vid. 
(06/14 08:50:14) vid: Recently something happened with the Great Zero, and all explorers who had completed all fourteen recalibration missions received the ability to reda their current position in the cavern on the KI. Can you explain why this doesn't work on the surface, as well as give an estimate on how far along the recalibration is? 
(06/14 08:50:36) From Thend: QUESTION 
(06/14 08:51:26) Victor Laxman: The Great Zero does not use electromagnetic energy for transmission. Another interesting D'ni technological aspect. 
(06/14 08:52:24) Victor Laxman: We suspect it uses some kind of transmission medium that can penetrate rock - which would make sense of course. 
(06/14 08:52:43) To Arthur Kalnins: You'll be next 
(06/14 08:53:16) Victor Laxman: Maybe something like nutrinos as a carrier. Very exotic, and very difficult for us to "dissect." 
(06/14 08:53:53) vid: But it's incapable of reaching surface distance? 
(06/14 08:53:57) Victor Laxman: The Great Zero was the reference point and had to be accurate to extremely high levels... 
(06/14 08:54:37) Victor Laxman: But even so, the farther you travel, the less accuracy there is... 
(06/14 08:55:13) Victor Laxman: (Because of the nature of the polar coordinate base that the GZ works on.) 
(06/14 08:55:53) Victor Laxman: So in close proximity to the GZ sometimes the KIs can be very accurate. But that doesn't mean... 
(06/14 08:56:12) Victor Laxman: that the GZ and KIs are fully calibrated for distance measurement. 
(06/14 08:56:15) Victor Laxman: Next? 
(06/14 08:56:18) CAGrayWolf: Arthur, you have another question? 
(06/14 08:56:22) Arthur Kalnins: The DRC said it had found Phil Henderson's crushed KI in the Guild Hall area. Were you able to positively identify it as Phil's KI and if so, how? 
(06/14 08:56:41) To DRCLeri1: You're next 
(06/14 08:56:51) From DRCLeri1: k. 
(06/14 08:57:14) From Swimmery4: Question 
(06/14 08:57:27) CAGrayWolf: Eleri, you have another question?You're after Eleri, who is next. 
(06/14 08:57:47) Victor Laxman: We did indeed find Phil's KI. We were able to identify it by removing a crystalline ID strand... 
(06/14 08:57:58) To GingerDiva: Disreagrd that. 
(06/14 08:58:18) To GingerDiva: Stupid KI 
(06/14 08:58:19) Victor Laxman: ...and placing it in another working KI. 
(06/14 08:58:27) Victor Laxman: Next? 
(06/14 08:58:34) CAGrayWolf: Eleri? 
(06/14 08:58:39) DRCLeri1: Forgive me if you've touched on this already, what is needed to bring the Great Zero to full functionality? 
(06/14 08:58:44) To GingerDiva: You're next 
(06/14 08:59:46) Victor Laxman: Simply put, more samples. The more samples we get, the greater the accuracy. It's not unlike surface based GPS... 
(06/14 09:00:19) Victor Laxman: recievers. You can keep then stationary, and they improve their locations by... 
(06/14 09:00:52) Victor Laxman: continuing to recieve satellite samples. 
(06/14 09:01:01) Victor Laxman: On a related note... 
(06/14 09:01:37) Victor Laxman: We have noticed that we may be gettting spurious data added into the valid... 
(06/14 09:02:11) Victor Laxman: calibration data. Unfortunately the only way we know to clear that up is full... 
(06/14 09:02:26) From DRCLeri1: question, again ;) 
(06/14 09:02:44) Victor Laxman: restart of the Great Zero itself. We're still evaluating if that will be necessary. 
(06/14 09:02:50) From Nikolas: QUESTION 
(06/14 09:02:56) Victor Laxman: Next? 
(06/14 09:02:59) CAGrayWolf: Ginger, you have a question? 
(06/14 09:03:11) GingerDiva: Victor, you mentioned the Primary Lattice... what is the extent of purpose of the primary lattice, and is there a secondary, tertiary etc... how many levels are you aware of and what do they each do? 
(06/14 09:03:26) From Jacuru: question 
(06/14 09:03:28) To Thend: You're next 
(06/14 09:04:53) Victor Laxman: The Primary or Prime Lattice is just one of hundreds. We had descibed it as primary because... 
(06/14 09:05:29) Victor Laxman: it's the first one we restored. Our understanding of the system is that the more Lattices that... 
(06/14 09:05:56) Victor Laxman: we bring "online" the faster the processing will be. The work seems to be distributed... 
(06/14 09:06:08) Victor Laxman: among all working Lattices. 
(06/14 09:06:14) Victor Laxman: next? 
(06/14 09:06:16) CAGrayWolf: Thend, you have a question? 
(06/14 09:06:23) Thend: Is the GZ powered by and/or utilize any of the principles inherent in any of Nikola Tesla's studies, the Earth's (natural or artificial) Ley Lines, and/or Sacred Geometry? If so, then how exactly? 
(06/14 09:06:32) To Swimmery4: You're next 
(06/14 09:07:27) From DRCLeri1: nifty question! 
(06/14 09:07:47) Victor Laxman: Not really. Tesla was primarily involved with electromagnetic radiation... 
(06/14 09:11:09) GingerDiva: have we lost Victor again? 
(06/14 09:11:21) vid: :( 
(06/14 09:11:29) CAGrayWolf: Momentarily, I see him back on my list 
(06/14 09:12:13) From Nikolas: please take me out of the queue. I will have to leave in a while 
(06/14 09:12:19) From DRCLeri1 in DRCLeri1's Relto: *sigh* 
(06/14 09:12:21) vid: I might recommend some going into first person.... that way your computer isn't havibf to deal with everyone around you... only those in front 
(06/14 09:13:33) GingerDiva: havibf? hehe 
(06/14 09:13:58) Victor Laxman: sorry - okay continuing on... 
(06/14 09:13:59) To Nikolas: I'll leave you for the moment, and if your name disappears I'll cross you off. 
(06/14 09:14:22) From DRCLeri1: he keeps crashing when I do. Weird. 
(06/14 09:14:44) Victor Laxman: There is spurious EM radiation from the GZ, but it is only a side effect. The primary functions are not... 
(06/14 09:14:47) To DRCLeri1: So it's YOUR fault! :p 
(06/14 09:15:19) Victor Laxman: related to EM. With that said it is entirely possible that the spurious EM radiation produced by... 
(06/14 09:15:27) From DRCLeri1: ppbbtt 
(06/14 09:15:55) Victor Laxman: GZ has been picked up and interpreted by varous cultures on the surface as... 
(06/14 09:15:59) From DRCLeri1: thank goodness for logs! I'll get the summary written ASAP after this, cause this is full of good stuff 
(06/14 09:16:16) From DRCLeri1: we can worry about editing the log for posting later :) 
(06/14 09:16:31) Victor Laxman: natural energy from the earth itself. Ley lines and effects may actually be nothing more... 
(06/14 09:16:36) From Thend: ANOTHER QUESTION 
(06/14 09:16:50) Victor Laxman: than garbage from the Great Zero. 
(06/14 09:16:55) Victor Laxman: Next? 
(06/14 09:16:57) CAGrayWolf: Swimmery, you have a question? 
(06/14 09:17:00) Swimmery4: You mentioned that the system was easy to upgrade quickly. My question is, did the D'ni have any upgrades for the system in the works before the Fall? If so, do you plan to finish/implement them? If so to the second question, how will you finish/implement them? 
(06/14 09:17:15) To DRCLeri1: You're next 
(06/14 09:17:43) To Nikolas: Eleri is next, then you. 
(06/14 09:17:47) Victor Laxman: We have found numerous upgrade plans for the KI. The problem is that we're actually... 
(06/14 09:18:28) Victor Laxman: re-writting our own upgrades so we don't inadvertantly add some "not so safe" functionality... 
(06/14 09:19:07) Victor Laxman: It's easier to write our own code then to try and revise their code. 
(06/14 09:19:45) Victor Laxman: We do use their code to learn from - and it provide much of the instruction for us to upgrade our own. 
(06/14 09:19:51) Victor Laxman: Next? 
(06/14 09:20:02) CAGrayWolf: Eleri? 
(06/14 09:20:03) From Nikolas: Well I've been covered...I withdraw my question. 
(06/14 09:20:08) DRCLeri1: There's an issue where some explorers lose their main GZ link, after starting on the 14 calibration missions. How can they fix that? 
(06/14 09:20:17) To Nikolas: OK :) 
(06/14 09:20:59) Victor Laxman: We're aware of this, and we're working on it. It may have something to do with the extra... 
(06/14 09:21:25) Victor Laxman: noise that the GZ is picking up. It is high on our priority list. 
(06/14 09:21:32) Victor Laxman: Next? 
(06/14 09:21:38) CAGrayWolf: Jacuru, you have a question? 
(06/14 09:21:41) Jacuru: spurious data, does that mean there is a second Zero somewhere else which is interfering, or just reflections from within the cave ? Or just interference between Until_Uru and Life :) 
(06/14 09:22:00) To Thend: You're next ... and last. 
(06/14 09:22:32) Victor Laxman: We're not sure what the source of the spurious signals is. But if the GZ is nutrino based... 
(06/14 09:23:18) Victor Laxman: we know that there are natural nutrino sources that send the particles from space... 
(06/14 09:23:47) Victor Laxman: through the earth. It could simply be that "background" noise that we haven't quite figured... 
(06/14 09:24:05) Victor Laxman: out how to filter. But we have some ideas. 
(06/14 09:24:08) Victor Laxman: Next? 
(06/14 09:24:11) CAGrayWolf: This will be the last question. Thend, you have a question? 
(06/14 09:24:14) Thend: I suspect that the D'ni Elite may've been able to utilize the GZ to emit a specific signal, among others, that could cause disorientation and/or unconsciousness in a KI wearer in order to control the 'lower' D'nizens from things such as straying 'too far' (ie. the surface). Is there any truth to this and could this function have contributed to P.HENDerson's 'accident' and/or been why he may've removed his KI before he 'disappeared'? 
(06/14 09:24:37) From DRCLeri1: *chuckle* 
(06/14 09:25:11) Victor Laxman: We have not seen any indication that the KI and GZ can be used to produce this effect... 
(06/14 09:25:37) From DRCLeri1: yay for conspiracy theories. 
(06/14 09:25:50) From DRCLeri1: D'ni Lone Gunmen 
(06/14 09:25:52) Victor Laxman: on people. The D'ni elite were rather proud it seems, but we don't think they had such... 
(06/14 09:26:21) Victor Laxman: devious control methods up there sleeves. If the KI was meant to be used as a control device... 
(06/14 09:26:34) Victor Laxman: they would have distributed them to the lower classes first. 
(06/14 09:27:04) Victor Laxman: But of course - if I knew that we could control all of you explorers with the KI, I would... 
(06/14 09:27:21) GingerDiva: lol 
(06/14 09:27:25) Victor Laxman: deny that I could and then punish you for asking that question. :)
