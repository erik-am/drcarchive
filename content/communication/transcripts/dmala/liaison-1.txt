(04/15 08:44:52) CAGrayWolf: Shorah and Good morning all.
(04/15 08:44:52) Tweek: hello
(04/15 08:45:02) Gadren: Mind if I take some pics for the imager?
(04/15 08:45:10) Marie Sutherland: I don't mind.
(04/15 08:45:24) Tweek: interesting image you have on the imager there.
(04/15 08:45:35) Gadren: Thanks, Marie
(04/15 08:45:43) Marie Sutherland: You're welcome.
(04/15 08:45:52) Gadren: O_o what's this place?
(04/15 08:46:14) Tweek: its like a weird combination of Kemo, Gira and Kadish Tolesa
(04/15 08:46:18) Gadren nods his head
(04/15 08:46:25) Marie Sutherland: One of the places we're working on.
(04/15 08:46:27) Tweek: pretty looking
(04/15 08:46:41) Gadren: Wow
(04/15 08:46:52) Gadren: It really is beautiful
(04/15 08:47:28) CAGrayWolf: Interesting indeed.
(04/15 08:47:41) Gadren: I can see that revolving floating thing from Kemo in the background...but it looks a little different
(04/15 08:48:00) Tweek: oh yeah
(04/15 08:48:12) CAGrayWolf: Could this be Beyond Gira?
(04/15 08:48:38) Marie Sutherland: No, it is not "beyond gira"
(04/15 08:48:53) Gadren: OK, Eleri just told me she's on her way
(04/15 08:48:57) Marie Sutherland: Many of the rest Ages have similar features.
(04/15 08:49:32) CAGrayWolf: Oh where are my manners. G'morning Maire, good to see you again. It has been quite sometime.
(04/15 08:49:33) Tweek: have always wondered what that plinth thing is...looks like its been broken in Kemo.
(04/15 08:49:55) Marie Sutherland: I'm not sure what it is, to be honest.
(04/15 08:50:09) Tweek: nice to see the DRC back, even if I didn't always agree on what went on <.<
(04/15 08:50:22) CAGrayWolf: Agreed Tweek
(04/15 08:50:25) Gadren nods his head
(04/15 08:50:50) Gadren waves

(04/15 08:55:58) CAGrayWolf: Yes, Vortmax
(04/15 08:55:59) Gadren: He's having some issues getting into the Cavern
(04/15 08:56:02) Gadren: <frown>
(04/15 08:56:09) Tweek: ah yes thank you for reminding me Vortmax said he is sorry to miss the meeting, he's having trouble getting down here
(04/15 08:56:23) CAGrayWolf: ahhh

(04/15 08:58:14) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh

(04/15 08:58:23) Tweek: we should vote to see if we want to vote
(04/15 08:58:31) CAGrayWolf: ACK!
(04/15 08:59:34) Gadren: vortmax was having trouble getting in...if he can't get in, we might have to go on without him?
(04/15 08:59:43) Gadren: <frown>
(04/15 08:59:44) Victor Laxman: we'll wait a bit longer - then we'll have to get on with things...
(04/15 08:59:49) Gadren: OK
(04/15 08:59:52) Tweek: righto
(04/15 08:59:59) CAGrayWolf: Sounds good.
(04/15 09:01:14) Tweek: oh, not sure if you answered regarding on whether that image of the rest age is for the public to see or not?
(04/15 09:01:22) Victor Laxman: thanks for helping out - even though your roles are not well defined yet
(04/15 09:01:31) Tweek: no prob
(04/15 09:01:37) Michael Engberg: How is everyone doing today?
(04/15 09:01:39) Eleri: we're adaptable, if nothing else
(04/15 09:01:44) Gadren: I'm doing graet
(04/15 09:01:51) Victor Laxman: adaptable is good these days
(04/15 09:01:55) CAGrayWolf: Still waking up here, but doing well.
(04/15 09:02:01) Gadren starts to laugh
(04/15 09:02:18) Eleri: I'm good, nice break from the noise on the surface
(04/15 09:02:29) Victor Laxman: it's always quieter in the cavern
(04/15 09:02:34) CAGrayWolf: Did anyone bring the donuts?
(04/15 09:02:35) Victor Laxman: i find
(04/15 09:02:39) Michael Engberg: Oh Marie I see you put an image on the imager...
(04/15 09:02:58) Victor Laxman: did you do that Marie?
(04/15 09:03:30) Victor Laxman: we're waiting just a bit more for vort
(04/15 09:03:37) Victor Laxman: one last thing to try
(04/15 09:03:57) Eleri: *nod*
(04/15 09:04:31) Victor Laxman: imager has an age that Marie's been "working on"
(04/15 09:04:44) Victor Laxman: very small place - but beautiful
(04/15 09:04:45) Gadren: It looks very interesting!
(04/15 09:04:51) CAGrayWolf: WOW! Very cool!
(04/15 09:04:51) Eleri: I's lovely. Looks like a great place for a picnic
(04/15 09:04:53) Tweek: nifty
(04/15 09:05:15) Eleri: Do you know the name?
(04/15 09:05:43) Victor Laxman: no - Marie might (but she is distracted right now)
(04/15 09:05:47) Victor Laxman:
(04/15 09:06:42) Dr. Kodama: I don't want to rush things but I will need to leave at 10:30.
(04/15 09:06:58) Tweek: least my new KI is working better than the old one.
(04/15 09:07:22) Victor Laxman: okay - almost ready
(04/15 09:07:44) Dr. Kodama: Why do each of you think you won the election?
(04/15 09:07:57) Michael Engberg: good to hear Tweek.. Well we could start.. why don't you all tell us just a few sentences about yourself??
(04/15 09:08:18) Gadren: Who should go first?
(04/15 09:08:19) CAGrayWolf: For me, I was actually surprised I won.
(04/15 09:08:25) Tweek: I won the election by bribing everyone with donuts..
(04/15 09:08:30) Gadren starts to laugh
(04/15 09:08:40) Victor Laxman: nicely done
(04/15 09:08:41) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh
(04/15 09:08:44) Michael Engberg: Garden lets start with you..
(04/15 09:08:46) Eleri: Luck, and good PR?
(04/15 09:08:55) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh
(04/15 09:08:55) Eleri: fire away, Gad
(04/15 09:09:13) Tweek: I dunno why I won, guess people like me, I'm usually busy in the community doing this and that and have done this kind of "job" before.
(04/15 09:09:17) Gadren: Oh, OK <smile> Well, I've been a part of the explorer community for a couple of years...
(04/15 09:09:26) Michael Engberg: oh and is anyone logging this?? Should it be logged?
(04/15 09:09:30) Gadren: I've done all sorts of different things and participated in a lot of projects
(04/15 09:09:34) Gadren: I'm logging this
(04/15 09:09:35) CAGrayWolf: I am
(04/15 09:09:37) Tweek: yes I am logging
(04/15 09:09:46) Victor Laxman: lot of lumberjacks
(04/15 09:09:48) Eleri: me four
(04/15 09:09:57) Eleri starts to laugh
(04/15 09:10:08) Gadren: As for why I think I won, I don't know...I guess part of it is that I'm somewhat well-known in the community and have done a fair amount for it in the past
(04/15 09:10:20) Michael Engberg: Very cool garden.. how about tweek next..
(04/15 09:10:32) Tweek: sorry for interuppting there gad.
(04/15 09:10:40) Dr. Kodama: I don't think his name is Garden, Michael.
(04/15 09:10:49) Gadren: <grin>
(04/15 09:10:56) Gadren: That's alright Tweek
(04/15 09:10:58) CAGrayWolf: Our own Garden Gadren
(04/15 09:10:59) Michael Engberg: opps!!!
(04/15 09:11:06) Gadren laughs
(04/15 09:11:06) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh
(04/15 09:11:20) Michael Engberg: Gadren... my eyes are tired this morning.. hehe
(04/15 09:11:34) Victor Laxman: seems like a fairly supportive group - kind of known for their support
(04/15 09:11:41) Gadren nods his head
(04/15 09:12:02) Tweek: Well, been in the community for a long time, worked on a lot of projects, most people seem to know me kind of guess that helped people have confidence me, luck goes a long way mind you ^_^
(04/15 09:13:20) Dr. Kodama: And GrayWolf...
(04/15 09:13:20) Michael Engberg: Who wants to go next?
(04/15 09:14:16) Eleri: go for it, Gray
(04/15 09:14:18) Victor Laxman: starting in two minutes - probably without vort - you all can fill him in if you don't mind
(04/15 09:14:26) Gadren nods his head
(04/15 09:14:45) CAGrayWolf: Well I have been here in the Cavren for almost 3 years now. I have been a supporter of many projects and have helped many an explorer. I have been active with the GoG as well. As I said, I'm still surprised I was elected ... though also grateful as well.
(04/15 09:15:18) Victor Laxman: were you all surprised you were elected - did anyone expect it?
(04/15 09:15:43) Tweek: half and half for me to be honest
(04/15 09:16:00) Michael Engberg: Very nice.. Eleri why don't you tell us a little about yourself before we start.
(04/15 09:16:01) Gadren: Me too; to tell the truth, I was thinking my election was somewhat probable
(04/15 09:16:02) Victor Laxman: good - just wondering
(04/15 09:16:10) Eleri: It was a good list of people, I figured I could be anywhere
(04/15 09:16:42) Eleri: Well, Same ans everyone else, really. I've been around the community, and done stuff to move it along.
(04/15 09:17:07) Eleri: I'm entirely too full of ideas
(04/15 09:17:39) Michael Engberg: Awesome.. Well, welcome everyone.. its a treat to be working with you..
(04/15 09:17:52) CAGrayWolf: Feeling is likewise.
(04/15 09:17:57) Gadren nods his head
(04/15 09:18:00) Eleri: It's good to see all of you down here again
(04/15 09:18:03) Tweek: agreed
(04/15 09:18:25) Victor Laxman: okay - let's just start in (I suppose we already have)
(04/15 09:18:48) Victor Laxman: this will be our gathering place (Uruto) for all future meetings
(04/15 09:19:18) Victor Laxman: and we'll shape the duties as we go - not sure what all you'll be able to handle
(04/15 09:19:50) Victor Laxman: we have some ideas for starting out that we can discuss in a moment
(04/15 09:20:17) Tweek: ok
(04/15 09:22:46) Tweek: apparently Vortmax is down here with another KI#
(04/15 09:25:31) Victor Laxman: we'll discuss it before Dr. K has to leave
(04/15 09:25:52) Gadren: Just FYI: Tweek told me vortmax's new KI#: 1783644
(04/15 09:26:19) Gadren: Sure, sounds good
(04/15 09:26:29) Eleri: Sounds good to me.
(04/15 09:26:51) Victor Laxman: quickly then - the first thing we thought would be good is a series of "Town Hall" meetings...
[Note: Wheely links in]
(04/15 09:27:05) CAGrayWolf: Shorah Wheely
(04/15 09:27:21) Eleri: Shorah, Wheely
(04/15 09:27:26) Wheely: Sorry. Dad could I talk to you a sec? Just us.
(04/15 09:27:27) Tweek: howdy
(04/15 09:27:38) Michael Engberg: Okay.. follow me...
[Note: Michael Engberg and Wheely walk off]
(04/15 09:27:53) Victor Laxman: since the DRC (or exDRC) members have been kind of quiet - we thought it might be good for them to...
(04/15 09:28:11) Victor Laxman: make themselves a little more available for questions...
(04/15 09:28:18) Victor Laxman: in a more formal way
(04/15 09:28:18) Eleri: I like that idea
[Note: Vortmax links in]
(04/15 09:28:21) Gadren: Shorah Vortmax!
(04/15 09:28:31) Vortmax2 waves
(04/15 09:28:37) CAGrayWolf: {{{{{ Vort }}}}}
(04/15 09:28:40) Gadren nods his head
(04/15 09:28:45) Victor Laxman: But it'll take some organization - and that's where we thought you might have some ideas
(04/15 09:28:49) Vortmax2: Finally! Glad I could make it! And thank you Marie
(04/15 09:28:51) Eleri: would it be an open question forum, or would you want a list of questions ahead of time?
(04/15 09:29:12) Victor Laxman: "open" would be fine - but we might not have all the answers
(04/15 09:30:12) Victor Laxman: anyway...
(04/15 09:30:13) Marie Sutherland: glad you could make it, vortmax
[Note: Wheely and Michael Engberg return]
(04/15 09:30:21) Michael Engberg waves
(04/15 09:30:23) Wheely: Bye dad! Bye everyone.
(04/15 09:30:27) Gadren: Bye Wheely!
(04/15 09:30:30) Tweek: cya Wheely
(04/15 09:30:31) CAGrayWolf waves
(04/15 09:30:32) Victor Laxman: hello Vortmax - welcome - sorry we had to start without you
(04/15 09:30:36) Eleri: bye!
(04/15 09:30:40) CAGrayWolf: Bye Wheely
(04/15 09:30:41) Marie Sutherland: Bye, Wheely
[Note: Wheely links out]
(04/15 09:31:06) Vortmax2: Understandable, Dr. Laxman. I'm sure the others can catch me up later.
(04/15 09:31:07) Victor Laxman: on the TH idea...
(04/15 09:31:14) Eleri: Maybe once a month, one DRC member, and one Liason could hold an open forum in one of the hoods?
(04/15 09:31:18) Victor Laxman: (to continue)...
(04/15 09:31:30) Dr. Kodama: Well, as I said, I, unfortunately, have to be leaving. I'm sure someone will catch me up later. Congratulations to you all again.
(04/15 09:31:37) Victor Laxman: we might want to start with a series of them...
(04/15 09:31:37) Gadren waves
(04/15 09:31:40) Dr. Kodama: I look forward to seeing things happen.
(04/15 09:31:44) Gadren nods his head
(04/15 09:31:47) Michael Engberg: Once a week.. I am thinking..
(04/15 09:31:48) Victor Laxman: to address a lot of questions...
(04/15 09:31:49) Tweek: bye Dr. Kodama
(04/15 09:31:56) CAGrayWolf: Bye Dr kodama
(04/15 09:32:07) Marie Sutherland: Bye
(04/15 09:32:12) Eleri: bye Dr Kodama
(04/15 09:32:36) Vortmax2: Goodbye Dr. Kodoma
[Note: Dr. Kodama leaves]
(04/15 09:32:36) Eleri: sorted by topic? To keep them from wandering all over?
(04/15 09:32:57) Victor Laxman: it also might be good to keep numbers small go to several hoods
(04/15 09:33:28) Victor Laxman: the person doing the TH could go to whichever hoods would like to host him
(04/15 09:33:30) Michael Engberg: Yes, I think the meeting should have a main topic.
(04/15 09:33:30) CAGrayWolf: Yes good idea. Prevent linking issues as we can.
(04/15 09:33:40) Victor Laxman: or her - which would allow smaller numbers
(04/15 09:33:59) Eleri: *nodnod*
(04/15 09:34:10) Victor Laxman: we also had a question for you all...
(04/15 09:34:37) Victor Laxman: there are certain "Cyan" employees who seem to be looked on as...
(04/15 09:35:02) Victor Laxman: contributers to the restoration. Would it be good to include them as well - as part...
(04/15 09:35:17) Victor Laxman: of the people who could be available for TH appearences?
(04/15 09:35:26) Gadren: I don't have a problem with it
(04/15 09:35:40) Tweek: nor me
(04/15 09:35:41) Vortmax2: That would probably be a good idea.
(04/15 09:35:48) Eleri: I think that would be good
(04/15 09:35:49) CAGrayWolf: I don't have a problem with this either.
(04/15 09:35:54) From Vortmax2: TH == Town Hall?
(04/15 09:36:03) To Vortmax2: Yes
(04/15 09:36:08) Victor Laxman: There sessions might focus on different questions - as you might guess.
(04/15 09:36:15) Eleri: People know that you brought Rand and others here before.
(04/15 09:36:41) Victor Laxman: We don't need an answer now - just something for you to think about
(04/15 09:36:48) CAGrayWolf: and we speak with Moke and GD quite often already.
(04/15 09:37:02) Eleri: when would you want to have the first Town Hall?
(04/15 09:37:06) Victor Laxman: you all should feel free to use this Hood as a place to meet yourselves
(04/15 09:37:10) Victor Laxman: by the way
(04/15 09:37:18) Tweek: thanks ^_^
(04/15 09:37:23) CAGrayWolf: oh cool ... thank you
(04/15 09:37:26) Gadren: Thanks <smile>
(04/15 09:37:26) Vortmax2 thanks you very much!
(04/15 09:37:29) Eleri: thank you
(04/15 09:37:30) Victor Laxman: first town hall should be fairly soon i think
(04/15 09:38:06) Eleri: do you want us to cat herd the organizing, based on your schedules?
(04/15 09:38:34) Tweek: well I am pretty much good for most times, though my body operates on GMT time so if its too late I could be napping somewhere.
(04/15 09:38:39) Victor Laxman: hmmm - it'll have to be a balance of our schedule and whatever time you think is best
(04/15 09:38:49) Marie Sutherland: Just as long as, That's another good thing to settle while we're here.
(04/15 09:39:14) Victor Laxman: but it would be a good sign for everyone to have it sooner - to show that you all are proactive...
(04/15 09:39:31) Michael Engberg: Let us not forget our internation explorers...
(04/15 09:39:35) Victor Laxman: and the positions (and elections) atually proved to be helpful
(04/15 09:39:38) Gadren nods his head
(04/15 09:39:40) CAGrayWolf: This time and day seems to work well.
(04/15 09:39:50) Eleri: *nod* My thought would be for you to give us the times you're available, and we'll get the meetings scheduled.
(04/15 09:40:32) Victor Laxman: we might want to let you ask around - and try different times - even for the same TH rep
(04/15 09:40:38) Victor Laxman: to include more people
(04/15 09:40:44) Eleri: a list of suggested topics, would be helpful, too. Maybe even what's off limits to talk about
(04/15 09:40:46) Marie Sutherland: Saturday's aren't good for me. I made an exception this morning, but wouldn't want it to be a habit
(04/15 09:40:53) Victor Laxman: several times during a day a rep could be available
(04/15 09:42:16) Victor Laxman: we can choose an entire day for a TH event
(04/15 09:42:44) Vortmax2: Spread out several meetings over a day, covering various topics?
(04/15 09:42:46) Victor Laxman: and make the rounds through whatever hoods want to be involved
(04/15 09:43:03) Eleri: I like that
(04/15 09:43:10) CAGrayWolf: Agreed
(04/15 09:43:26) Tweek: see the DLA site would have been perfect for this...mind you we do that the Planner site that lists events going on down in the cavern...
(04/15 09:43:38) Victor Laxman: we'll we are happy to let you decide who you think should start off the TH events and when to start
(04/15 09:44:04) Eleri: What you guys have been up to, will be one of the biggest questions
(04/15 09:44:14) Victor Laxman: are you all comfortable doing that and letting us know
(04/15 09:44:15) Victor Laxman: ?
(04/15 09:44:30) Tweek: yep
(04/15 09:44:32) Eleri: I'm good
(04/15 09:44:33) CAGrayWolf: yes
(04/15 09:44:34) Gadren: <smile>
(04/15 09:44:40) Vortmax2: I think so <smile>
(04/15 09:44:49) Victor Laxman: yes - some of the questions will be hard to answer, but useful
(04/15 09:45:01) Michael Engberg: Remember to work with other people in the community to help you.. it will make it easier ..
(04/15 09:45:27) Marie Sutherland: I'll be the main point of contact
(04/15 09:45:29) Michael Engberg: sometimes.. <smile>
(04/15 09:45:47) Victor Laxman: we will assign Marie as the point-person to recieve KI-mail from you...
(04/15 09:45:52) Eleri: what's the easiest way to contact you, Marie?
(04/15 09:45:56) Victor Laxman: if that's alright with you Marie?
(04/15 09:45:56) Gadren: cool
(04/15 09:46:23) Marie Sutherland: Laxman, Kodama, and Engberg are notorious for not checking their PMs for days (weeks) at a time
(04/15 09:46:24) Victor Laxman: but you may also run into any of us in this hood
(04/15 09:46:47) Victor Laxman: we'll try to be better about it Marie
(04/15 09:46:51) Eleri: *chuckle*
(04/15 09:46:51) Marie Sutherland: PM-ing me on the DRC site forums is fine
(04/15 09:46:56) Michael Engberg: <smile>
(04/15 09:47:01) Vortmax2: <grin>
(04/15 09:47:10) CAGrayWolf: I have to ask ... since many are asking ... have you heard where Dr Watson is ... or at least how he is doing ... Is he well?
(04/15 09:47:21) Gadren: Good question
(04/15 09:47:26) Marie Sutherland: I check them daily, even if I don't always respond. <grin>
(04/15 09:47:32) Victor Laxman: we will also try to make it a point to check into Uruto whenever we're passing through the cavern
(04/15 09:48:18) Eleri: You're welcome into my hood any time, too.
(04/15 09:48:38) Victor Laxman: no comments on Dr. Watson - there are things that are best left unanswered at the moment...
(04/15 09:48:46) Gadren: aww
(04/15 09:48:53) CAGrayWolf: ok ... thank you.
(04/15 09:48:57) Victor Laxman: issues that are better addressed at a later time...
(04/15 09:49:10) Vortmax2: Somehow I suspected that <wink>
(04/15 09:49:15) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh
(04/15 09:49:19) Gadren: heehee
(04/15 09:49:20) Eleri: sounds like a whole lot has happened
(04/15 09:49:25) CAGrayWolf: Yea, same here.
(04/15 09:49:50) Marie Sutherland: I'm just waiting to see RAWA and Dr. Watson at the same place at the same time...
(04/15 09:49:53) Victor Laxman: when the explorers are less fragmented
(04/15 09:50:07) Tweek: hehe
(04/15 09:50:21) Eleri: things would implode. Like some sort of Watsony vortex
(04/15 09:50:28) Vortmax2: On that note, it does seem that the fragmentation is healing again.
(04/15 09:50:37) Michael Engberg: Victor, who is planning the next meeting?
(04/15 09:50:42) Eleri: It comes and goes
(04/15 09:50:55) Victor Laxman: exactly - some answers would lead to chaos
(04/15 09:50:58) Vortmax2: (And it probably always will, Eleri)
(04/15 09:51:04) Tweek: yes, we'll see it again next time elections come around
(04/15 09:51:10) CAGrayWolf: ebbs and wanes like the tide / moon ... something like that
(04/15 09:51:17) Gadren: how poetic
(04/15 09:52:10) Victor Laxman: next meeting - is it useful to meet with everyone? or should not worry about meeting with smaller...
(04/15 09:52:18) Victor Laxman: groups of liasons?
(04/15 09:52:46) Eleri: we'll keep in touch pretty consistantly, so if some of us can't make it, no one will miss out
(04/15 09:52:48) Tweek: well I'd be surprised if we can get 100% attendence all the time,
(04/15 09:52:50) Gadren: smaller meetings wouldn't be too bad, since the missing liaisons can pass things on
(04/15 09:52:58) CAGrayWolf: My schedule is quite a bit more flexible.
(04/15 09:53:08) Victor Laxman: that might be easier - you all can certainly communicate amoung yourselves
(04/15 09:53:14) Gadren: wow -- that's fast
(04/15 09:53:24) Eleri: I'm almost always around, but can't always get here
(04/15 09:53:42) Vortmax2: And there can always be technical issues... <wink>
(04/15 09:53:49) Victor Laxman: <smile>
(04/15 09:53:51) Michael Engberg: <smile>
(04/15 09:53:58) Marie Sutherland: <grin>
(04/15 09:53:59) Eleri: *hands Vortmax duct tape and a hammer*
(04/15 09:54:02) Gadren: <smile>
(04/15 09:54:15) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh
(04/15 09:54:41) Victor Laxman: let's try another meeting during the week
(04/15 09:54:57) Gadren: OK...most evenings are good for me
(04/15 09:54:58) Michael Engberg: Ok
(04/15 09:55:08) Vortmax2: Same here. Afternoons and evenings are good.
(04/15 09:55:10) Victor Laxman: not everyone will make it - but we'll touch base and see how things are going
(04/15 09:55:19) Eleri: good plan
(04/15 09:55:23) Victor Laxman: evenings are better for everyone?
(04/15 09:55:27) Victor Laxman: generally?
(04/15 09:55:35) Eleri: *nod*
(04/15 09:55:45) Vortmax2 nods his head
(04/15 09:55:52) Tweek: depends what time zone you are going by
(04/15 09:56:00) Victor Laxman: any "time zone" issues we should know about?
(04/15 09:56:03) Vortmax2: (Probably US timezones)
(04/15 09:56:23) Tweek: evening in say central US is late night in the UK
(04/15 09:56:25) Eleri: I'm pacific time
(04/15 09:56:29) Gadren: Two questions (sorry to interrupt):Had we reached a consensus on releasing chat logs? and is that Age image on the imager allowed to be released to the explorers?
(04/15 09:56:34) Tweek: GMT here.
(04/15 09:56:34) Gadren: I'm central daylight time
(04/15 09:56:41) Victor Laxman: tweek is UK - evenings are rough
(04/15 09:57:08) Tweek: hmm mind you after next tuesday evenings should be ok
(04/15 09:57:13) Marie Sutherland: And don't trust time zone converters on the internet... (blush)
(04/15 09:57:15) Victor Laxman: might try afternoons - we'll try different things next week and see how it works
(04/15 09:57:19) Gadren starts to laugh
(04/15 09:57:23) Eleri: heh
(04/15 09:57:41) Vortmax2: This whole BST/GMT thing is getting me confused too...
(04/15 09:57:55) Victor Laxman: Gadren's questions - chat logs are up to you - but conservative is better to begin with
(04/15 09:57:58) Eleri: Yes, Marie, what age is that on the imager?
(04/15 09:58:33) Eleri: Good idea, Gadren <smile>
(04/15 09:58:34) Victor Laxman: and feel free to take images of the imager <smile>
(04/15 09:58:45) CAGrayWolf: I would like to ask one more question. Seems most have been upset with the term switching between "rep" and "liaison" Can we all agree on one term?
(04/15 09:58:50) Gadren: I've gotten images of just about everything and everyone
(04/15 09:59:02) Marie Sutherland: That is Eder Delin
(04/15 09:59:09) Vortmax2: Oooooooh...
(04/15 09:59:12) Gadren: Eder Delin...hmmm
(04/15 09:59:16) CAGrayWolf claps his hands
(04/15 09:59:24) Eleri: It's beautiful.
(04/15 09:59:24) Marie Sutherland: It's a fairly small Age. But a nice place to wind down.
(04/15 09:59:28) Gadren: I assume that's [d][eh][l][ih][n] in the D'ni letters, right?
(04/15 09:59:28) CAGrayWolf: Very interesting ......
(04/15 09:59:29) Vortmax2: Soooo... Any idea when we'll get to see it in person?
(04/15 09:59:48) Victor Laxman: Liason seems less inflamatory - but open to whatever you think
(04/15 10:00:00) Vortmax2: (I HAD to ask)
(04/15 10:00:04) Marie Sutherland: I believe so, Gadren, but I could be wrong.
(04/15 10:00:04) CAGrayWolf: Agreed on Liaison
(04/15 10:00:05) Gadren starts to laugh
(04/15 10:00:06) Tweek: well I don't really mind between rep and liaison to be honest...seeming we are kinda doing bother...reps are a pain because people will complain about their groups not being represented
(04/15 10:00:15) Eleri: I like liason
(04/15 10:00:22) Victor Laxman: right
(04/15 10:00:22) Gadren: So, Liaison it is?
(04/15 10:00:28) Tweek: ok with me
(04/15 10:00:29) Victor Laxman: for now
(04/15 10:00:31) Eleri: maybe we could ask RAWA for a good word
(04/15 10:00:37) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh
(04/15 10:00:40) Michael Engberg: People will be looking for the chat logs of this meeting today .. so the sooner you can release them .. the better <smile>
(04/15 10:00:43) Tweek: dictators is a good word <.<
(04/15 10:00:53) Gadren: I've always wanted to call ourselves "Links", since we're links between the DRC and explorers
(04/15 10:01:00) Eleri: Underground Overlords! <wink>
(04/15 10:01:02) Vortmax2: I like Emperor, myself, Tweek. <smile>
(04/15 10:01:07) Victor Laxman: i like "masters of time, space, and dimension"
(04/15 10:01:13) Eleri: oooooooo
(04/15 10:01:14) Michael Engberg: bahro blood drinkers??
(04/15 10:01:17) CAGrayWolf: We should divide up the forums amungst us ... and then post. Sound like a plan?
(04/15 10:01:17) Vortmax2 laughs
(04/15 10:01:18) Victor Laxman: easier to spell then liansonsinon
(04/15 10:01:18) Eleri: eew!
(04/15 10:01:19) Gadren: bwahaha
(04/15 10:01:36) Vortmax2: Yeah, this Bahro blood sure is tasty!
(04/15 10:01:56) Michael Engberg: and it can make you fly... <smile>
(04/15 10:02:10) Victor Laxman: okay, well thanks again so much for your help...
(04/15 10:02:12) Gadren: Don't you know? Bahro Blood gives you wings!
(04/15 10:02:21) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh
(04/15 10:02:22) Marie Sutherland: The best way to fly is to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
(04/15 10:02:23) Vortmax2: (OOh, the DRC have a sense of humor! They'll never believe this one!)
(04/15 10:02:25) Victor Laxman: hopefully nothing but good will come from this new arrangement...
(04/15 10:02:31) Eleri starts to laugh
(04/15 10:02:47) Victor Laxman: but we're open to any suggestions if the need arises
(04/15 10:02:54) Vortmax2: I've been trying that one for years, Marie. I'm never properly distracted.
(04/15 10:02:54) Eleri: Anything you want us to pass on directly, right now?
(04/15 10:03:34) Victor Laxman: Please thank everyone for bearing up under the pressures of the elections...
(04/15 10:03:38) Tweek: hmm wonder what Delin means in anything
(04/15 10:03:46) Tweek: will do
(04/15 10:04:03) Victor Laxman: we do know it was not always pleasant - and we have learned quite a bit as we move forward
(04/15 10:04:04) Michael Engberg: I would say let people know about the TH meetings - asap.. Even if you say more details are coming.
(04/15 10:04:14) Victor Laxman: yes - good mike
(04/15 10:04:18) Marie Sutherland: I would guess it's a safe bet that it does, Tweek.
(04/15 10:04:57) CAGrayWolf: Good plan.
(04/15 10:04:58) Vortmax2: I've got some images too, and I'll post them as well, if I can find a good place.
(04/15 10:05:07) Victor Laxman: let me end by saying that the DRC is not the same as it once was...
(04/15 10:05:41) Tweek: The fact that you have opted for liaisons shows that Victor
(04/15 10:05:45) Gadren nods his head
(04/15 10:05:45) Victor Laxman: without Dr. Watson we're simply a loosely organised group that is drawn to the cavern
(04/15 10:05:52) CAGrayWolf: Victor, this is quite obvious to those of us who have been around awhile ... and good to see I might add.
(04/15 10:05:53) Victor Laxman: much like all of you
(04/15 10:06:37) Gadren: ^_^
(04/15 10:06:40) Victor Laxman: it's a team effort at this point - thanks for being part of it
(04/15 10:06:41) CAGrayWolf: drawn = tugged = YANKED!
(04/15 10:06:51) Michael Engberg: <smile>
(04/15 10:07:00) Victor Laxman: okay photo op
(04/15 10:07:03) Eleri: We all want to be here, and do what we can
(04/15 10:07:04) Vortmax2 laughs
(04/15 10:07:08) Tweek: and because Wolfie is akward I have to set up specific permissons just for him >.<
(04/15 10:07:34) Victor Laxman: where is a good place for a group photo?
(04/15 10:07:38) Eleri: Marie, scooch over there by the guys
(04/15 10:07:43) Victor Laxman: balcony?
(04/15 10:07:57) Tweek: by the scope I would have thought
(04/15 10:07:57) Victor Laxman: we can all face the "camera"?
(04/15 10:08:04) Gadren: How about the community room?
(04/15 10:08:09) Gadren: Or the classroom?
(04/15 10:08:18) Gadren: Actually, the classroom would be better...closer up
(04/15 10:08:26) Victor Laxman: classroom - good
(04/15 10:08:30) Gadren: ^_^
(04/15 10:08:32) Victor Laxman: let's try it
(04/15 10:09:50) Gadren: Where's Eleri?
(04/15 10:09:51) Victor Laxman: very nice!
(04/15 10:10:10) Vortmax2: Eleri! Where'd you go?
(04/15 10:10:15) Gadren: Eleri! Up here!
(04/15 10:10:24) Gadren waves
(04/15 10:10:33) Vortmax2: Oh no! She's gone!
(04/15 10:11:09) Gadren: Well, at least I got this pic
(04/15 10:11:19) Tweek: hmm well could always photoshop her in if you can extract the image to a computer ^_^
(04/15 10:11:25) Gadren starts to laugh
(04/15 10:11:57) Gadren: Oh well, maybe we can get a full one later (with Kodama too)?
(04/15 10:12:12) Vortmax2: Perhaps <smile>
(04/15 10:12:13) Tweek: ah yes, knew we were missing someone else too.
(04/15 10:12:52) Gadren: So...anything else for this meeting?
(04/15 10:12:59) Michael Engberg: awww!!!
(04/15 10:13:07) Vortmax2: Yeah! When do we get to see Kahlo? <grin>
(04/15 10:13:13) Gadren starts to laugh
(04/15 10:13:35) Tweek: lol
(04/15 10:13:35) Vortmax2: Thanks for the picture! Very nice <smile>
(04/15 10:13:35) Eleri: Well, that was unpleasant
(04/15 10:13:39) Victor Laxman: this meeting is over (by default) <smile>
(04/15 10:13:47) CAGrayWolf: WB Eleri
(04/15 10:13:48) Victor Laxman: El is back
(04/15 10:13:49) Vortmax2 laughs
(04/15 10:13:51) Gadren: Hi Eleri!
(04/15 10:13:54) Tweek: wb Eleri
(04/15 10:13:57) Gadren: We're in the classroom...c'mon in!
(04/15 10:14:40) Gadren: c'mon up here
(04/15 10:14:53) Victor Laxman: Eleri?
(04/15 10:15:07) CAGrayWolf: This we lost her agehn
(04/15 10:15:27) Vortmax2: I think she's here, but not on the Age Player list. It's a common KI bug.
(04/15 10:15:32) Gadren: Yay!
(04/15 10:15:36) Vortmax2: Yup, there she is!
(04/15 10:15:38) CAGrayWolf: True Vort
(04/15 10:15:50) Vortmax2: Heh, there's something maybe you guys could work on.
(04/15 10:16:02) Gadren: Got the pic
(04/15 10:16:45) Michael Engberg: see you all later
(04/15 10:16:46) Michael Engberg waves
(04/15 10:16:51) Vortmax2: So long!

(04/15 10:17:03) Marie Sutherland: Thank you all
(04/15 10:17:05) Michael Engberg: Have a wonderful day...
(04/15 10:17:13) Vortmax2: Thank you for doing this!
(04/15 10:17:19) Victor Laxman: bye everyone - thanks again!
(04/15 10:17:28) Tweek: byee
(04/15 10:17:34) Victor Laxman waves
(04/15 10:17:36) CAGrayWolf: Bye all ... and thank you.
(04/15 10:17:39) Tweek waves
(04/15 10:17:40) CAGrayWolf waves
(04/15 10:17:53) CAGrayWolf: oh ... duh!
(04/15 10:17:55) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh
(04/15 10:18:11) Tweek: you know Victor looks scarily similar to my uncle Alan
(04/15 10:18:16) Vortmax2 laughs
(04/15 10:18:49) Victor Laxman: no nexus this time - good thing we're all Yeesha enabled
(04/15 10:18:53) Marie Sutherland: We need maintenance to come check that door.
(04/15 10:19:04) Vortmax2: Oh no, your doors are broken?
(04/15 10:19:14) Tweek: ^_^ how did you guys find the journey?
(04/15 10:19:14) CAGrayWolf starts to laugh
(04/15 10:19:17) From Eleri in Eleri's Relto: I'll hop on the form soon. I'm being summoned to the surface
(04/15 10:19:27) CAGrayWolf: DRC ... Yeesha enabled?
(04/15 10:19:32) Marie Sutherland waves
(04/15 10:19:38) Vortmax2 waves
(04/15 10:19:39) Tweek waves
(04/15 10:19:52) Tweek: yep took the journey after the phil issue apparently
(04/15 10:20:01) CAGrayWolf: Cool
