Dr. Kodama: It's past 11. First question?
Whilyam: How has your stance on explorers changed since taking the Journey?
Dr. Kodama: I'm not sure it has changed.
ABguy: So, Phil Henderson, Sharper, and Watson what gives?
Dr. Kodama: What do you mean by that? What gives?
ABguy: What happened to them?
ABguy: What does the DRC know anyway?
Dr. Kodama: Sharper is probably excited about the upcoming draft.
Dr. Kodama: Henderson is probably smoking drugs and Watson...no one seems to know.
Dr. Kodama: Kidding, of course.
Kai-Uwe: Will there be any chance in the future, that we explorers could support the DRC in exploring a new discovered age?
Whilyam: At the liaison meeting the DRC said that Watson's situation was something best left for another time. Just what does that mean? You don't know? You think it is too destabilizing?
Dr. Kodama: If I'm to answer for myself, personally, I'm not sure where Watson stands. I have not spoken to him for some time.
Dr. Kodama: I have attempted to contact him with no luck.
subumbra: how many people are there currently in the DRC?
vid: Dr. Kodama, have you ever been involved with any surface expeditions and restoration? And if so, how does that compare to working in D'ni?
Dr. Kodama: Yes, both are similar.
Dr. Kodama: Both have moments of excitement and moments of just work
Dr. Kodama: But both are rewarding.
Dr. Kodama: and, sometimes, frustrating.
Anna Catherine: What has the DRC been up to lately? Working on anything interesting?
Halvor: Are you planning on working closer with the explorers (and groups like The Great Tree) in the future than you have done in the past?
Dr. Kodama: Halvor. I think we will work a little more closely although that can mean different things to different people. subumbra: what are the DRCs immediate plans, should the funding come through?
Dr. Kodama: sub - Begin working on Ages.
Alahmnat: how hard is it to do restoration work in a suit?
Dr. Kodama: The suit is only for meetings like these
Whilyam: Marie has said that the reason the picture of Eder Delin looks like Kemo is because all rest ages have the same basic features. If this is so, when will we see the "rest" portion of Eder Gira?
Dr. Kodama: I don't believe the "rest" portion of Eder Gira is on top of the priority list.
Halvor: What is your position on the DRC?
Halvor: What part do you play in restoring ages?
Dr. Kodama: Council member. Oversee Phase One and Two restoration work.
Dr. Kodama: Which means the early work.
Dr. Kodama: Structural integrity and the like.
Whilyam: We've heard that you and Mr. Engberg are working on the Kahlo Age. What state is the Age in now and when do you expect it to be finished?
Dr. Kodama: Hmm. It's not in a good state. There is still quite a bit of work to do and we simply don't have the manpower to do it right now.
Dr. Kodama: I don't know a date.
ABguy: mineral rights to the cavern who owns them and what is there to prevent another party from taking them i.e. oil companies or entrepenures?
Dr. Kodama: I try to stay out of those aspects. I'll leave that to the lawyers.
Dr. Kodama: Were you interested in mining?
Ti'chelle: Hello Dr. Kodama. Has a base number of hopeful explorers been set to secure further funding? 
Dr. Kodama: I'm not sure there is a magic number. 
Dr. Kodama: I prefer to focus on the Ages until someone tells me to stop because we have no money.
Nootilus: The city is dark and eerie. Is there any plan to revive it a bit?
Nootilus: Any chance to have some warm places in other words?
Dr. Kodama: Plans...yes. Soon...probably not to any large degree.
Dr. Kodama: Warm places? There are a few I have been to.
subumbra: Should the DRC get the funding it needs, is there any plan to open sections of the City Proper?
Dr. Kodama: Again, plans...yes. As to how soon, I can't say. There is obviously a lot of city and we would love to open it all...someday.
wkwalker: Speaking of opening the city...any idea on the sequence? I'd love to get access to the 2nd floor of the Kadish Library, for example.
wkwalker: oops...Kdaish Galery
Dr. Kodama: There are some buildings that are in better shape than others. The J'Taeri Hood has been looked at.
Dr. Kodama: I'm not sure I can speak to an exact schedule as there is so much up in the air right now in regards to time and resources.
Dr. Kodama: That will determine a lot of the schedule.
vid: Dr. Kodama, what's been your favorite age to visit and work on so far?
Dr. Kodama: Rebek. Dr. Kodama: And Pento a close second.
vid: Why Rebek?
Dr. Kodama: It's beautiful, unique, and has a lot to do in it.
Alahmnat: should funding come through, are there any plans to better enable the distribution of news and other explorer-created content in-Cavern? Or should I ask Laxman this afternoon?
Dr. Kodama: We have addressed that in various meetings. Yes, we would love to have a Guild of Messengers at some point who carry the news and we have discussed mechanisms for them to better be able to do that.
Whilyam: The official word from the DRC about Phil's last accident was that he fell during a collapse of a bridge in the Guild Hall. However, many saw a plume of smoke rising from the Hall and many first described the event as an "explosion." Could you explain the smoke and the event more clearly?
Dr. Kodama: I believe the smoke and explosion was merely the collapse of a structure. Such a collapse can come across as an "explosoin"
Dr. Kodama: There was a large section of structure that collapsed creating a tremendous cloud of dust and noise. ireenq_translator: Susi would like to ask if the Funder has set a certain date, for decision, and when that is?
Dr. Kodama: Those issues are out of my hands.
Dr. Kodama: When someone tells me to stop, I"ll stop. Until then, I'll work.
Eleri: How did you first come to D'ni and the DRC, and what was your recation to the discovey?
Dr. Kodama: I knew Dr. Watson because of our connections in the teaching profession. He first asked me for a visit in '94 and I was, of course, amazed.
Dr. Kodama: I have seen some amazing places on this Earth - there are many - and the cavern was yet another.
Dr. Kodama: I was pleased to work with Dr. Watson and accept his request for his aid in this restoration effort. It was not a difficult decision.
