(05/22 13:18:55) Marie Sutherland: Good morning.
(05/22 13:19:55) Marie Sutherland: Another update.
(05/22 13:20:34) Marie Sutherland: The rescue teams began work on the second floor a little over an hour ago.
(05/22 13:21:16) Marie Sutherland: There was more damage on the third floor, so it was slower going.
(05/22 13:22:07) Marie Sutherland: As many of you know, we lost the signal from Wheely's KI around 11:30 last night.
(05/22 13:23:25) Marie Sutherland: That in and of itself is not a reason for increased concern, but...
(05/22 13:24:00) Marie Sutherland: her condition when we last spoke with her is reason enough.
(05/22 13:25:26) Curty: wheelys KI is back on!!
(05/22 13:25:27) Marie Sutherland: The rescue teams are doing their best to get us to Wheely as soon as they can.
(05/22 13:25:41) Victor Laxman: That was odd.
(05/22 13:28:22) Marie Sutherland: She is on the first floor, we hope to the place right above where she is within the next 6-12 hours.
(05/22 13:29:00) Wheely: Dad are you there?
(05/22 13:29:07) Marie Sutherland: Hmm...
(05/22 13:29:10) Wheely: Dad?
(05/22 13:29:41) Wheely: Dad are you there?
(05/22 13:29:50) Wheely: Where's my dad?
(05/22 13:30:36) Wheely: Dad
(05/22 13:30:42) Michael Engberg: Thank god Wheely!
(05/22 13:30:54) Marie Sutherland: I'll be back later.
(05/22 13:30:54) To Dangerzone: engberg "Thank god Wheely"
(05/22 13:31:01) Michael Engberg: Oh I'm so glad to see you here. How are you doing? We haven't heard from you in so long.
(05/22 13:31:10) Wheely: Dad I feel really good.
(05/22 13:31:19) Wheely: I'm not even thirsty!
(05/22 13:31:26) Wheely: What happened?
(05/22 13:31:48) Michael Engberg: I don't know. We're still coming for you.
(05/22 13:31:56) Michael Engberg: We're going to be there soon.
(05/22 13:32:11) Michael Engberg: You were always so strong. I'm so proud of you.
(05/22 13:32:40) Wheely: The eyes are still there.
(05/22 13:32:44) Michael Engberg: Okay.
(05/22 13:33:04) Wheely: But I feel good. I can hear them above me.
(05/22 13:33:12) Wheely: How close are you?
(05/22 13:33:30) Michael Engberg: We're getting very close. We've been working all night honey. We all can't wait to see you again.
(05/22 13:33:39) Michael Engberg: I'm so glad to hear from you. It's been a long night.
(05/22 13:33:49) Michael Engberg: Can you tell us anything that happened?
(05/22 13:34:10) Wheely: Not really. I was so tired last time. I went to sleep. I think.
(05/22 13:35:01) Wheely: Dad... Rose is still here. Dad... she's dead. She's never moved. Dad.
(05/22 13:35:27) Michael Engberg: Honey it's alright. I'm so sorry for you. But we are going to get you.
(05/22 13:35:46) Michael Engberg: I'm sorry for Rose. But remember it's not your fault.
(05/22 13:36:21) Michael Engberg: Do you know why your KI was off? Can you tell us anything that happened?
(05/22 13:36:40) Michael Engberg: Wheely?
(05/22 13:37:23) Michael Engberg: Willow are you there?
(05/22 13:38:14) Wheely: Sorry, dad. I'm so sad for Rose.
(05/22 13:38:28) Wheely: She's just laying there.
(05/22 13:39:07) Michael Engberg: Baby we're coming. We're going to get you both out.
(05/22 13:39:23) Michael Engberg: How is your leg?
(05/22 13:39:52) Wheely: It still hurts but the tingling is gone. And my head doesn't hurt anymore either.
(05/22 13:40:21) Wheely: I don't know what happened. I feel so much better. But I just want to get out even more now dad. I don't like being so close to Rose.
(05/22 13:40:29) Wheely: And the eyes.
(05/22 13:41:03) Michael Engberg: We were so worried. I'm not sure what happened but I'm so happy. Baby, you were not good last night.
(05/22 13:41:24) Wheely: I know. It's good. But I'm still scared.
(05/22 13:41:26) Michael Engberg:
(05/22 13:41:40) Michael Engberg: Can you see any more of your surroundings? Is there space above you?
(05/22 13:42:08) Wheely: It seems normal. I can't see a lot.
(05/22 13:42:23) Wheely: But the eyes aren't too far away. They just keep staring. I wish they would go away.
(05/22 13:42:44) Michael Engberg: Wheely, those eyes may have saved you. They aren't there to hurt you.
(05/22 13:42:51) Michael Engberg: Don't worry about the eyes.
(05/22 13:43:00) Wheely: Yeah, I guess...
(05/22 13:44:04) Michael Engberg: I don't know how else to explain how good you are feeling...
(05/22 13:44:18) Michael Engberg: I'm so happy.
(05/22 13:45:03) Wheely: How much longer dad?
(05/22 13:45:30) Michael Engberg: We're working hard. Just a few more hours.
(05/22 13:46:00) Michael Engberg: Now that you're feeling better, baby, we're going to get there. We have time now.
(05/22 13:46:05) Michael Engberg: Thank god.
(05/22 13:46:16) Wheely: I know. But I want you to hurry. I'm still scared.
(05/22 13:46:41) Michael Engberg: We are hurrying. We're going as fast as we can, of course.
(05/22 13:47:44) Wheely: The eyes just left. They're gone. It's moving in here. Dad, hurry up
(05/22 13:48:07) Michael Engberg: We're coming babe. Remember, it's not hurting you.
(05/22 13:48:35) Michael Engberg: Wheely. What's going on?
(05/22 13:48:42) Yellowdog: Did Wheely just link?
(05/22 13:49:10) Amun Aten: yeah she went to kadish
(05/22 13:49:11) Yellowdog: I heard the linking noise just as she left!
(05/22 13:49:17) Michael Engberg: Wheely what's going on?
(05/22 13:49:21) Michael Engberg: Are you there?
(05/22 13:49:26) Michael Engberg: Laxman?
(05/22 13:49:28) Ly'net: Wheely is in Kadish!
(05/22 13:49:35) Victor Laxman: Her coordinates show here the entire time. I'm not sure what these anomalies are.
(05/22 13:49:43) Michael Engberg: Anomalies?
(05/22 13:49:56) Michael Engberg: What do you mean?
(05/22 13:50:01) Michael Engberg: Do you see what the KI is doing?
(05/22 13:50:09) Amun Aten: now gahreesen
(05/22 13:50:35) Michael Engberg: You are sure she's here? in the rubble?
(05/22 13:50:50) Amun Aten: and now relto

(05/22 13:50:57) Michael Engberg: Wheely. Where are you?

(05/22 13:51:23) Ly'net: gone
(05/22 13:51:28) Victor Laxman: she's still here, Michael. I don't know what's going on.
(05/22 13:51:35) Michael Engberg: What do you mean?
(05/22 13:52:01) Michael Engberg: This isn't normal.
(05/22 13:52:06) Ly'net: did she go topside?
(05/22 13:52:08) To Dangerzone: Engberg this isn't normal.
(05/22 13:52:12) Michael Engberg: Wheely! Can you hear me?
(05/22 13:52:19) Victor Laxman: Her Ki was returning it's location from several different Ages, but her signal never moved.
(05/22 13:52:31) Michael Engberg: Laxman, can you get the KI back on? It's off again. We need it on.
(05/22 13:52:40) Michael Engberg: Willow?
(05/22 13:52:40) Victor Laxman: I'm trying.
(05/22 13:53:22) Amun Aten: and now engberg is back in relto
(05/22 13:55:06) Whilyam: Laxman, it shows Engberg in Relto. Did he leave?
