(05/22 14:35:15) Nick White: Not for a while. If he's tracking the thing or something he's not going to be sending me messages.
(05/22 14:35:21) Nick White: I'm sure he's fine.
(05/22 14:35:31) Cully Barger: Why, Nick - Ki interference?
(05/22 14:35:59) Cully Barger: or just too preoccupied?
(05/22 14:36:00) Monkeyboy: I hope he took a bazooka with him
(05/22 14:36:00) Nick White: He turns the KI off - doens't want it beeping and spooking animal or something.
(05/22 14:36:05) Cully Barger: Ah
(05/22 14:36:12) isabella39: good idea
(05/22 14:36:19) darkstar: No tracking takes concentration no time for distractions like sending messages
(05/22 14:36:20) Akin: ah, he's probably fine then
(05/22 14:36:23) matt7188: 'ello all
(05/22 14:36:32) SuperGram.: Hi everyoone
(05/22 14:36:35) Nick White: Got some other weird news though.
(05/22 14:36:39) Scarlette: Hi sg
(05/22 14:36:44) Ashtar: What's that Nick?
(05/22 14:36:49) Joy Electric: dish!
(05/22 14:36:50) Monkeyboy: oh, good I hope
(05/22 14:36:50) isabella39: hi gram
(05/22 14:36:51) matt7188: what news?
(05/22 14:37:05) Nick White: Apparently the DRC - and I'm hearing this through the rumor mill - has seen a symbol on the second floor.
(05/22 14:37:11) Scarlette: Ti' you are on hood
(05/22 14:37:19) S'eahag: Ooooh!
(05/22 14:37:19) Robert The Rebuilder: Of the building that Wheely was in, Nick?
(05/22 14:37:27) matt7188: a bahro simbol or what
(05/22 14:37:36) Akin: any pics taken of it?
(05/22 14:37:39) isabella39: which symbol is it?
(05/22 14:37:47) Joy Electric: will the DRC make a picture of it available?
(05/22 14:37:50) Erik: Shorah Nick
(05/22 14:38:14) darkstar: Is it being linked to the cavings report?
(05/22 14:38:17) Nick White: I'm not sure.
(05/22 14:38:36) Cully Barger: Where is the symbol, again, Nick?
(05/22 14:38:44) Nick White: The deal is it sounded a bit familiar - something I had seen before - at least from what I was hearing.
(05/22 14:38:51) Ashtar: I hope the DRC can send us some pictures of this new symbol, or post them on the imagers.
(05/22 14:38:59) Monkeyboy: Do you know if they plan on going through it? Or avoid it?
(05/22 14:38:59) Joy Electric: lets remember to ask Sutherland the next time she gives us an update
(05/22 14:38:59) matt7188: can you discribe it
(05/22 14:39:06) Nick White: So I went out to Negilahn this morning on a little hike.
(05/22 14:39:10) Akin: was the symbol etched into a wall?
(05/22 14:39:14) Robert The Rebuilder: What did you find, Nick?
(05/22 14:39:19) Nick White: Yeah, it was etched on the second floor.
(05/22 14:39:21) darkstar: What do we know about that building is there any information on what the D'Ni where using it for?
(05/22 14:39:25) Nick White: Again, that's what I hear.
(05/22 14:39:39) Erik: Tell us something about your trip please.
(05/22 14:39:40) Akin: the floor of the second floor?
(05/22 14:39:42) Nick White: Weird deal is I saw a similar symbol on a tree in Negilahn.
(05/22 14:39:46) matt7188: what about your hike
(05/22 14:39:46) Kam Uraki: Whoa, hey Nick. You fall asleep for a bit and look what happens
(05/22 14:39:46) Nick White: Wall.
(05/22 14:39:53) isabella39: really...
(05/22 14:39:57) Akin: hmm
(05/22 14:39:59) Erik: Really? That's odd
(05/22 14:40:02) Scarlette: Ooh that's interesting
(05/22 14:40:06) Robert The Rebuilder: Can you describe the symbol, Nick?
(05/22 14:40:11) darkstar: can we take it that it maybe linked to the predator then?
(05/22 14:40:12) Joy Electric: did you take a picture of it?
(05/22 14:40:14) Nick White: Wall somewhere on the second floor.
(05/22 14:40:17) Akin: can you describe what the symbol looks like?
(05/22 14:40:20) Atheni33: Do you have a pic of the symbol..on the tree?
(05/22 14:40:25) Nick White: Yes, I did take a picture of it. Three times.
(05/22 14:40:32) Nick White: This is where it gets more weird.
(05/22 14:40:34) Monkeyboy: Did it come out?
(05/22 14:40:43) isabella39: why three times
(05/22 14:40:47) Nick White: In my KI every time, it was just the tree. No symbol.
(05/22 14:40:51) Robert The Rebuilder is amazed!
(05/22 14:40:54) Scarlette: Didn't show up?
(05/22 14:40:55) isabella39: ahh
(05/22 14:40:56) Nick White: Freaky stuff is going on guys.
(05/22 14:40:59) S'eahag: That is wierd
(05/22 14:41:00) Nick White: I'm telling you.
(05/22 14:41:02) Atheni33: ah...curious
(05/22 14:41:03) Akin: whoa
(05/22 14:41:05) matt7188: more wierd!!!
(05/22 14:41:06) Monkeyboy: What do think it is?
(05/22 14:41:06) D'ean: like the stone on the balcony?
(05/22 14:41:10) Erik: like the Bahro stone on that balcony in all hoods
(05/22 14:41:11) Akin: that IS weird
(05/22 14:41:19) Robert The Rebuilder: So, given that there are no pictures, can you describe the symbol, Nick?
(05/22 14:41:21) Joy Electric: not unexpected, the Bahro tablet on the Balcony does the same thing
(05/22 14:41:23) Erik: You can't take a picture of that stone either
(05/22 14:41:29) Akin: doesn't show up on a photo, but does to the naked eye...
(05/22 14:41:30) darkstar: like the D'Ni numbers on the pic in Sharpers office
(05/22 14:41:33) Nick White: Yeah, but this was carved in a tree.
(05/22 14:41:51) Nick White: I mean I could put by finger in the groove.
(05/22 14:41:52) Scarlette: Hmmm
(05/22 14:41:56) Scarlette: Very weird
(05/22 14:41:56) Joy Electric: might be an optical effect
(05/22 14:42:03) Robert The Rebuilder: Nick: Is the symbol related to the predator?
(05/22 14:42:09) xendi: Hes in uo bevin.. nick white
(05/22 14:42:11) darkstar: get a rubbing next time your there
(05/22 14:42:15) Joy Electric: you can see it but it comes out as a tree on film
(05/22 14:42:21) matt7188: was it like claw marks or a knife cut?
(05/22 14:42:25) Scarlette: Ohh good idea darkstar!
(05/22 14:42:26) Nick White: It's a line - circle on the top and a circle o the bottom on the other side.
(05/22 14:42:35) isabella39: lol
(05/22 14:42:39) Erik: Do you think the Bahro have anything to do with Negilahn's problems?
(05/22 14:42:59) Scarlette: Sounds like a percentage or "no" sign?
(05/22 14:43:04) Monkeyboy: like a division symbol, Nick?
(05/22 14:43:07) Nick White: I don't know. I don't know what's going on. I do know something is going on.
(05/22 14:43:21) Akin: yeah
(05/22 14:43:23) D'ean: a T shape with two O's?
(05/22 14:43:23) Akin: thats weird
(05/22 14:43:24) Nick White: Percentage sign. Sure. Similar.
(05/22 14:43:27) Erik: I think we all sense that... weird stuff is going on
(05/22 14:43:32) Scarlette: Hmm ok
(05/22 14:43:39) Joy Electric: is the line horizontal or vertical?
(05/22 14:43:50) Kam Uraki: So the symbol looks like the Satellite of Love on Mystery Science Theater 3000?
(05/22 14:43:52) Nick White: Vertical.
(05/22 14:43:59) matt7188: and you couldn't take a pictuer of it?
(05/22 14:43:59) JWPlatt: Division symbol? :)
(05/22 14:44:00) Leonor: Isn't that the time symbol?
(05/22 14:44:06) ireenquench: hey Nick
(05/22 14:44:16) Nick White: I took pictures. Just didn't show up.
(05/22 14:44:25) Monkeyboy: lol, JwPlatt
(05/22 14:44:26) Robert The Rebuilder: Nick: besides the symbol, did you notice anything else in Negilahn?
(05/22 14:44:29) Vivicus: Greetings mr. White!
(05/22 14:44:42) Scarlette: Doo de doo doo... you are now... in the T-Zone!
(05/22 14:44:42) Nick White: Nothing unusual.
(05/22 14:44:47) Leonor: Don't the Bahro have a symbol for time like that?
(05/22 14:44:49) Vivicus: symbol in Negilahn?
(05/22 14:44:54) Akin: could you take me or one of us to check it out?
(05/22 14:45:04) Akin: i'll draw it and send it around to others.
(05/22 14:45:07) matt7188: ill go
(05/22 14:45:09) Robert The Rebuilder: A weird percentage symbol, carved into a tree, Vivicus
(05/22 14:45:14) Erik: What about Sharper's expedition by the way? Any succes so far?
(05/22 14:45:16) Vivicus: ok, thanks :)
(05/22 14:45:22) Ashtar: You too Sherry, and big hugs to you :)
(05/22 14:45:22) Joy Electric: you'd chance the predator?
(05/22 14:45:25) Scarlette: And that same sign was in Negilahn pod?
(05/22 14:45:29) Yali: There's a carving in Negilahn??
(05/22 14:45:44) Nick White: This stuff with Wheely feeling good is weird too.
(05/22 14:45:51) Nick White: I'm happy but I don't get it.
(05/22 14:45:56) Robert The Rebuilder: WHo do you think healed Wheely, Nick?
(05/22 14:46:03) Nick White: I don't know man.
(05/22 14:46:06) Akin: yeah
(05/22 14:46:09) Erik: Yeah, like the Bahro are healing her .... but that sounds just weird
(05/22 14:46:10) Yali: hmm, Yeesha?
(05/22 14:46:16) imara: can bahro heal?
(05/22 14:46:19) Monkeyboy: Is she responsive?
(05/22 14:46:20) Akin: maybe
(05/22 14:46:22) 4runner: Could be the bahro
(05/22 14:46:22) Robert The Rebuilder: So Nick: Bahro - are they friend or foe?
(05/22 14:46:23) Nick White: I wish we knew more about the Bahro, I'll tell you that.
(05/22 14:46:26) S'eahag: Or the cave healed her
(05/22 14:46:29) Scarlette: Sounds to me like one is watching over her and taking care of her
(05/22 14:46:29) Cully Barger: No longer thirsty but has received no water - strange
(05/22 14:46:33) Joy Electric: Yeesha was in the Cavern last night
(05/22 14:46:34) Nick White: We should have been finding out stuff long before this.
(05/22 14:46:39) Scarlette nods her head
(05/22 14:46:42) imara: she was?
(05/22 14:46:46) darkstar: could be delirium
(05/22 14:46:50) ireenquench: We don't know if she was healed right? She could just be delusional.
(05/22 14:46:54) Robert The Rebuilder: Or opium
(05/22 14:46:54) Erik: Yeesha was in the cavern??
(05/22 14:47:02) Yali: no she wasn't
(05/22 14:47:05) Joy Electric: a Relto page was placed
(05/22 14:47:05) Atheni33: She did draw the water symbol in the dirt and the Bahro took it
(05/22 14:47:34) Akin: how does a bahro "take" something drawn in dirt?
(05/22 14:47:45) matt7188: erase it?
(05/22 14:47:49) Nick White: There are way too many rumors going around right now.
(05/22 14:47:56) Cully Barger: truly
(05/22 14:47:56) ireenquench nods her head
(05/22 14:48:04) D'ean: lol, yeah
(05/22 14:48:06) Robert The Rebuilder: Nick: are the DRC letting you help with Wheely's rescue?
(05/22 14:48:10) Atheni33: :)
(05/22 14:48:10) S'eahag: Lol, you think?!
(05/22 14:48:14) Nick White: Although I'm sure what I said we'll become one of them now.
(05/22 14:48:15) Joy Electric: we can read it in her memoirs that'll be published eventually wink.gif
(05/22 14:48:20) SuperGram.: I was told that Wheely awoke no longer thursty and feeling better. Sounds like she got water somehow......
(05/22 14:48:24) darkstar: The building that collapsed do we know its original purpose?
(05/22 14:48:30) Monkeyboy: More than you might know
(05/22 14:48:36) Nick White: Tokotah right?
(05/22 14:49:06) Nick White: I don't know - I thought it was housing. Upper class stuff.
(05/22 14:49:06) Akin: marie's making a statement
(05/22 14:49:13) Nick White: What is she saying?
(05/22 14:49:15) Atheni33: I am just happy she is doing better
(05/22 14:49:17) darkstar: Below tokotah surely
(05/22 14:49:33) Erik: I hope someone can ask her about that symbol
(05/22 14:49:36) D'ean: yeah, please relay it
(05/22 14:49:41) Akin: alexanders gonna relay it
(05/22 14:49:59) darkstar: M - we are trying to determine whats happened to m wheelys Ki
(05/22 14:50:22) Robert The Rebuilder: Nick: Did you know Rosette at all?
(05/22 14:50:53) Nick White: Met her in Portland I think. Long time ago. She's been Wheely's friend for a while.
(05/22 14:51:06) Nick White: Never saw her down here.
(05/22 14:51:09) Robert The Rebuilder: So sorry to hear about her. I hope her family was contacted.
(05/22 14:51:14) darkstar: Maine or oregon?
(05/22 14:51:15) Joy Electric: do the new pith helmets scare you Nick? wink.gif
(05/22 14:51:19) Nick White: I think they have been.
(05/22 14:51:23) Vivicus: must go, Cya everyonoe!
(05/22 14:51:27) Nick White: No Joy. They do not.
(05/22 14:51:34) Nick White: See ya Viv.
(05/22 14:51:55) Nick White: Any update on Marie?
(05/22 14:51:59) darkstar: Ms Victor Laxman has not been able to figure out why it was behaving the way it was
(05/22 14:52:15) Leonor: I did a sketch of the symbol you described, Nick. Can I send it to you so you confirm I understood it right?
(05/22 14:52:16) Tori ~: Ms?
(05/22 14:52:17) Joy Electric: they're trying to find out what happened to the KI
(05/22 14:52:33) Joy Electric: it was on the first floor when it went offline
(05/22 14:52:34) Kierra: MS= Marie sutherland
(05/22 14:52:39) Robert The Rebuilder: Nick: should we or shouldn't we go into the City via the Kadish Gallery "back door"?
(05/22 14:52:54) Joy Electric: Engber'g relieved Wheely's feeling better
(05/22 14:52:59) darkstar: M - as far as he can tell it was coming from the 1st floor of that building when it went offline
(05/22 14:53:03) Nick White: Yeah Leonor.
(05/22 14:53:22) darkstar: Micheal is relived that Wheely is feeling better
(05/22 14:53:43) Nick White: I would. The city isn't closed. That's up to you though.
(05/22 14:53:49) Robert The Rebuilder: Thanks, Nick.
(05/22 14:53:55) Erik: thanks for keeping us up to date, darkstar
(05/22 14:53:59) darkstar: marie Even though it eas showing as that it was in other ages
(05/22 14:53:59) Scarlette: You would what, nick?
(05/22 14:54:29) Monkeyboy: Other Ages? Her KI?
(05/22 14:54:44) darkstar: The signal yes
(05/22 14:54:49) Tori ~: Anyone hear anything about, Sidney Austin?
(05/22 14:54:52) darkstar: Q and a
(05/22 14:54:53) Kierra: Strange
(05/22 14:55:06) DukeMan: When I was in the city a few minutes ago they had blocked off the gallery doors
(05/22 14:55:15) Joy Electric: she's dead praise Yahvo
(05/22 14:55:24) 4runner: I understand they closed the main gallery doors.
(05/22 14:55:27) darkstar: Thats sick
(05/22 14:55:29) Sumatria: how cold!
(05/22 14:55:34) Nick White: Sydney is dead?
(05/22 14:55:35) MattUtah would like to ask Nick a question
(05/22 14:55:39) Nick White: What?
(05/22 14:55:39) thumbs down for Kierra
(05/22 14:55:40) Kaelri: No news on Sydney, though I've been following the rescue attempts.
(05/22 14:55:40) Atheni33 shakes her head
(05/22 14:55:57) Robert The Rebuilder: I've heard of copycat murders, but copycat caveins?
(05/22 14:55:57) Ti'chelle: We don't know until the body is found.
(05/22 14:56:03) Joy Electric: I'm sorry, but I'm not going to feel bad about her death (Sydney's I mean)
(05/22 14:56:12) SuperGram.: Right now I'm more concerned with the rescue of Wheely
(05/22 14:56:22) Sumatria: I went back to look more for her today, could not find any sign of her
(05/22 14:56:31) Nick White: Sydney is pulling a publicity stunt. I don't buy it.
(05/22 14:56:31) SuperGram.: Anymore from MS? darkstar
(05/22 14:56:33) Kaelri: Nick, Sydney was trapped in the vault on Kadish when the tear on her Relto book caused it to malfunction.
(05/22 14:56:39) ireenquench: Nick I sent you a KI mail, could you check if thats what the symbol looked like?
(05/22 14:56:39) Kaelri: Possible.
(05/22 14:56:42) PiperDriver: No, she isn't.
(05/22 14:56:45) darkstar: Still waiting for an udate
(05/22 14:56:52) Ti'chelle cheers
(05/22 14:56:54) Scarlette says DOH!
(05/22 14:56:59) Robert The Rebuilder: How did you sketch it, Ireen: via ASCII characters?
(05/22 14:57:03) Scarlette: Some people will do anything for attention
(05/22 14:57:06) Nick White: Yes she is. And i find the timing pretty sick.
(05/22 14:57:07) Kierra: Lol
(05/22 14:57:10) Ti'chelle: I agree Nick about Syd
(05/22 14:57:10) Sumatria: I dont' think she is this time Nick
(05/22 14:57:10) ireenquench nods her head
(05/22 14:57:20) Robert The Rebuilder: You are the ASCII queen!
(05/22 14:57:29) Scarlette: You know what they say about crying wolf..
(05/22 14:57:31) petfam: I agree nick
(05/22 14:57:33) PiperDriver: Nick, you don't know what you are talking about. If you want the details, come talk to me sometime.
(05/22 14:57:46) Kaelri: A chatlog was posted on the DRC forum if you want to judge it for yourself. I'm taking Ethan at his word on the matter.
(05/22 14:57:59) Nick White: Line is not as straight.
(05/22 14:58:09) Nick White: Circle on left higher up.
(05/22 14:58:13) Nick White: Circle on right lower.
(05/22 14:58:14) Joy Electric: Marie says they believe Wheely's still there
(05/22 14:58:19) Nick White: And filled in.
(05/22 14:58:22) Robert The Rebuilder: Nick: you deal with translations, right? What does this symbol mean to you?
(05/22 14:58:23) darkstar: M - its impossible to tell if she;s still on the 1st floor until they have visual confirmation by they think shes still there
(05/22 14:58:30) Akin: we should try forming this symbol once its right
(05/22 14:58:31) Sumatria: Ip/ Ly'net no
(05/22 14:58:32) ireenquench: ok thanks both filled?
(05/22 14:58:34) Sumatria: oops
(05/22 14:58:36) Joy Electric: is it like the symbal in Minkata?
(05/22 14:58:47) Erik: That really is that speed up time symbol I believe
(05/22 14:58:49) SuperGram.: Good to hear and thanks Jo
(05/22 14:58:53) Robert The Rebuilder: Uh, what symbol in Minkata?
(05/22 14:58:53) JWPlatt (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(05/22 14:58:57) Erik: Or not...
(05/22 14:59:06) Kierra: Lol,beat me to it Robert
(05/22 14:59:13) isabella39: symbol for rain?
(05/22 14:59:15) Robert The Rebuilder: Jinx! Buy me a coke!
(05/22 14:59:20) Kierra is a bit puzzled...
(05/22 14:59:24) SuperGram.: any word as to what level the rescuers are at now?
(05/22 14:59:25) Tori ~ waves hello
(05/22 14:59:31) Kierra: Coke? ick!
(05/22 14:59:39) Joy Electric: OOC: I'm speaking of the one on the coming soon page
(05/22 14:59:40) isabella39 says hey
(05/22 14:59:49) Kierra offers a plate of cookies instead
(05/22 14:59:51) Ti'chelle raises her Coke in a salute
(05/22 14:59:52) MattUtah: Have we heard from Wheely since her KI went offline?
(05/22 15:00:09) Robert The Rebuilder: Nick: How do you interpret the symbol?
(05/22 15:00:12) Nick White: Any word on Marie?
(05/22 15:00:34) darkstar: Nothing yet
(05/22 15:00:35) Joy Electric: Marie's answering questions I believe
(05/22 15:01:19) Akin: who's working on the sybol nick described?
(05/22 15:01:23) Robert The Rebuilder: Ireen is
(05/22 15:01:29) Robert The Rebuilder: She sent Nick a sketch
(05/22 15:01:36) Joy Electric: Nick check on the glowing symbol in Minkata and see if it's similar to the one you saw in Negilahn
(05/22 15:01:39) darkstar: Alexander has sent Marie a KI message with detaiuls of extra ides but she has'nt read it yet
(05/22 15:01:39) Akin: after ireen has it - we should form it.
(05/22 15:01:44) Kierra: What's the symbol about now? I just linked in a few ago
(05/22 15:01:52) MattUtah: a symbol in Negilahn?
(05/22 15:01:57) Robert The Rebuilder: Kierra: Nick found it on a tree in Negilahn
(05/22 15:02:01) Akin: yeah
(05/22 15:02:04) Robert The Rebuilder: He was unable to photograph it
(05/22 15:02:09) darkstar: the teams are working in shifts so they are getting rest
(05/22 15:02:11) Kierra: Weeeeeird!
(05/22 15:02:13) Akin: and on the second floor of the takotah building
(05/22 15:02:15) Nick White: I'm just specualting.
(05/22 15:02:24) Kierra is a bit puzzled...
(05/22 15:02:26) SuperGram.: then the Bahro come and pick us all up? :)
(05/22 15:02:27) Robert The Rebuilder: Plus, he heard the same symbol was on the 2nd floor of the building in which Wheely was trapped
(05/22 15:02:36) Nick White: But have you wondered why the predator has never been seen around the POds?
(05/22 15:02:49) imara: we should move away from the link in spot
(05/22 15:02:49) Nick White: I think the symbol may have something to do with it.
(05/22 15:02:49) Scarlette: Yes!!
(05/22 15:03:00) Robert The Rebuilder: SO, the symbol is a protection symbol?
(05/22 15:03:01) S'eahag: Ah, a warding sign!
(05/22 15:03:09) Kierra: Thats very interesting about the symbol....more evidence to my Bahor theory
(05/22 15:03:09) Scarlette: Hmm as in it "keep" them away?
(05/22 15:03:16) Robert The Rebuilder: If so, why would it be on the 2nd floor of that building?
(05/22 15:03:16) Kaelri: A crazy theory off the top of my head; are the Bahro protecting the pods, perhaps?
(05/22 15:03:21) ireenquench: sent it to you again Nick
(05/22 15:03:32) Leonor: Was my symbol similar? Sorry I'm a bit distracted.
(05/22 15:03:33) ireenquench: would you recheck ,please?
(05/22 15:03:36) Monkeyboy: Protectcting Wheely?
(05/22 15:03:43) Akin: yeah
(05/22 15:03:51) Finn Dove: from what?
(05/22 15:03:55) Akin: it could be a protection symbol
(05/22 15:04:01) Nick White: Close - more right to left on the line. Different angle.
(05/22 15:04:02) Monkeyboy: dunno
(05/22 15:04:04) Akin: from any type of harm
(05/22 15:04:06) darkstar: expected time to rescue 6 to 8 hours
(05/22 15:04:09) Kierra: Those crazy wacky bahro...!
(05/22 15:04:15) Nick White: But yeah, basically that.
(05/22 15:04:24) Kaelri: Ah, good to hear that, darkstar.
(05/22 15:04:25) Robert The Rebuilder: Man - we should patent that symbol and license it to Trojan.
(05/22 15:04:34) Joy Electric: omg
(05/22 15:04:34) Kierra starts to laugh
(05/22 15:04:36) Scarlette: Hmm mso did you see the predator at all Nick?
(05/22 15:04:36) Joy Electric: lol
(05/22 15:04:39) Nick White: Anyone ask Marie about the symbol?
(05/22 15:04:40) S'eahag roars with laughter
(05/22 15:04:46) Nick White: Nice one.
(05/22 15:04:46) Erik: Now we finally get to know some more about the Bahro's intentions it seems
(05/22 15:04:51) darkstar: i asked she be asked
(05/22 15:05:03) Kierra: Just your luck though, the symbol'd probably ward off all of your romatic interests too tongue.gif
(05/22 15:05:03) Nick White: I wonder if they'll admit it.
(05/22 15:05:06) Scarlette: And was it in the negilah pod? or in the cave where wheely's at?
(05/22 15:05:11) Robert The Rebuilder: lol Kierra
(05/22 15:05:12) darkstar: questrioned asked
(05/22 15:05:35) darkstar: Marie emphises the timings are an estimate
(05/22 15:05:50) ireenquench: tried again
(05/22 15:06:03) darkstar: M- confrims a symbol was found on the 2nd floor
(05/22 15:06:07) Ti'chelle: Nick, can you be barred from coming down here, for leaking us info?
(05/22 15:06:12) Scarlette: !!!
(05/22 15:06:20) Kierra: Hum, wow
(05/22 15:06:31) darkstar: only if a dummy grasses him up
(05/22 15:06:34) Robert The Rebuilder: darkstar - can you ask how recently the symbol was placed there?
(05/22 15:06:41) Nick White: wow, they admitted it. Good.
(05/22 15:06:49) Robert The Rebuilder: No longer a rumor.
(05/22 15:06:49) Joy Electric: lol
(05/22 15:06:52) Kierra taps her chin in thought
(05/22 15:06:53) Nick White: Alright, I'm heading out.
