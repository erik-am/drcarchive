Nick White: Busy here.
Dav'on: Shorah, Nick!
(03/09 00:52:33) Niika: Woah, it's Nick! Hello
(03/09 00:52:46) Aleks: Hello there. Good to finally meet you.
(03/09 00:52:48) Nick White: What's happening?
(03/09 00:52:55) Nick White: Good to meet you.
(03/09 00:53:13) Aleks: Not much, it seems. People thought Sharper might happen by today.
(03/09 00:53:33) Nick White: He's pretty busy... I doubt he will.
(03/09 00:53:41) Nick White: He's back though.
(03/09 00:53:47) Arthur Kalnins: Sharper isn't coming down today?
(03/09 00:53:55) Arthur Kalnins: or rather coming in
(03/09 00:54:02) Nick White: Coming in?
(03/09 00:54:06) Gondar: Ah, there we go. KI is working again.
(03/09 00:54:12) Nick White: He's in the cavern if that's what you mean.
(03/09 00:54:15) Gondar: Hey Nick.
(03/09 00:54:16) Arthur Kalnins: To talk to people
(03/09 00:54:16) Niika: So, the DRC's accepted him back into the fold?
(03/09 00:54:21) Nick White: Yeah.
(03/09 00:54:32) Gondar: ..and he's accepted being back in the fold?
(03/09 00:54:38) Nick White: Not sure if he'll go around hoods or anyting - like I said he's pretty buys.
(03/09 00:54:40) Aleks: Cate seems to be rather keen on him, in any case.
(03/09 00:54:41) Nick White: busy
(03/09 00:54:47) Nick White: Yeah...
(03/09 00:55:01) Arthur Kalnins: So what exactly is he working on?
(03/09 00:55:15) Nick White: Right now, just setting up shop.
(03/09 00:55:21) Arthur Kalnins: In Negilahn?
(03/09 00:55:27) Nick White: No.
(03/09 00:55:30) Niika: shop?
(03/09 00:55:32) Nick White: Teledahn.
(03/09 00:55:35) Arthur Kalnins: Ah
(03/09 00:55:45) Arthur Kalnins: I thought his stuff was all there already
(03/09 00:55:52) Arthur Kalnins: Or are all those crates empty?
(03/09 00:55:55) Gondar: So they have him to resume work? Or is he just setting 'base camp' so to speak?
(03/09 00:56:00) Nick White: Right.
(03/09 00:56:00) Aleks: I see. So he will be working on that Teledahn II area, huh?
(03/09 00:56:15) ireenquench: Shorah
(03/09 00:56:15) Gondar: Er, work in Teledahn.
(03/09 00:56:15) Niika: They let him back into Teledahn? Wow
(03/09 00:56:15) Nick White: Just "making the rounds"
(03/09 00:56:20) Nick White: That kind of stuff.
(03/09 00:56:24) Arthur Kalnins: Will he be resuming work on Teledahn?
(03/09 00:56:31) Nick White: I suppose eventually.
(03/09 00:56:35) Arthur Kalnins: Or continuing in the other areas
(03/09 00:56:38) Nick White: I think Negilahn is task one.
(03/09 00:56:40) Niika: checking up on shroomie no doubt
(03/09 00:57:02) Aleks: Ah, I see. He's gonna see what's up with the animals, I guess.
(03/09 00:57:10) Nick White: I believe so.
(03/09 00:57:17) Gondar: In a way it's good he's back and about. Hopefully he can figure out how to help the animals there.
(03/09 00:57:27) Nick White: Agreed.
(03/09 00:57:32) Niika: Do you still think that it's some sort of preditor?
(03/09 00:57:37) Nick White: Except for the "in a way" part....
(03/09 00:57:42) Nick White: Yeah.
(03/09 00:57:44) Arthur Kalnins: Nick, I need some clarification here... Has the DRC found Gehn's Age 233?
(03/09 00:57:44) ireenquench: Do you know anything about why specifially he is going to check up on the Negilahn animals? Seems like an odd choice on Cate's end.
(03/09 00:57:47) Gondar: Of course..
(03/09 00:58:19) Nick White: I think he's the most experienced with dealing with predatory creatures.
(03/09 00:58:38) Nick White: Uh... not that I know of on the Gehn's Age thing..
(03/09 00:59:01) ireenquench: So predator is still the current guess? I hope it's not some wild chase against Bahro.
(03/09 00:59:03) Arthur Kalnins: Cyan put out a statement in their Riven soundtrack that it had been.
(03/09 00:59:09) Arthur Kalnins: Something higher up?
(03/09 00:59:15) Arthur Kalnins: than you.
(03/09 00:59:17) Aleks: Makes sense. Though alien predators could be a very scary thing.
(03/09 00:59:19) Nick White: Arthur, not sure what you mean...
(03/09 00:59:26) Gondar: Poor Nick.. enough of these grilling sessions and he'll end up like Kodama. Dry sarcastic wit and a no comment :-D
(03/09 00:59:27) Arthur Kalnins pulls out quote
(03/09 00:59:37) Niika: Do you think he might organize a hunting party?
(03/09 00:59:50) ireenquench shivers
(03/09 00:59:53) Nick White: I think he'll probably want to see what he's dealing with first.
(03/09 01:00:05) Niika: Nick's great. He's the only one who actually talks to us :D
(03/09 01:00:23) Aleks: And the other Pod ages? I hear there's a population drop in some of them as well?
(03/09 01:00:29) Gondar: Exactly.. and in retrurn we pepper him with questions. Let us know if you mind, Nick..
(03/09 01:00:30) Arthur Kalnins: It mentions "partial translations of this document (parts of Gehn's journal) provided taken from Gehn's office during further experditions to age 233."
(03/09 01:00:30) Nick White: Yep - all of them.
(03/09 01:00:48) Nick White: Not sure Arthur.
(03/09 01:00:53) Aleks: Any idea why that might be?
(03/09 01:00:59) Nick White: I don't have experience with Gehn's journal.
(03/09 01:01:15) ireenquench: Must be some strange predator if it does it in ALL ages.
(03/09 01:01:22) Arthur Kalnins: You would understand how that Age would be VERY interesting to see.
(03/09 01:01:25) Aleks: Unless the Bahro are doing it....
(03/09 01:01:30) Nick White: The drop has beent he worst in Neg
(03/09 01:01:34) Nick White: But slight drops in all of them.
(03/09 01:01:47) Gondar: Different predators I assumed ireen. Was there any signs the D'ni had any sort of forced balance to the ages? To keep popul;ation in check?
(03/09 01:01:48) Nick White: Yes, Arthur, I do understand that.
(03/09 01:01:54) Niika: All pod ages?
(03/09 01:01:58) ireenquench: I had been thinking Bahro as well, but not predator, rather more : noah's arch
(03/09 01:02:05) Gondar: Perhaps to ensure people could see creatures who normally would be rare?
(03/09 01:02:13) Nick White: They were messing with creature populations a bit it would seem - similar to a zoo.
(03/09 01:02:24) Aleks: Might be something set up by the D'ni, true.
(03/09 01:02:31) Gondar: And now that the keepers are gone, the tigers eat the zebras. Yeah. :-
(03/09 01:02:43) Kedry: Hello!
(03/09 01:02:49) Aleks: But its strange that it would take so long, and all at once.
(03/09 01:02:56) Aleks: Across ages, no less.
(03/09 01:03:08) Nick White: Yeah, weird stuff.
(03/09 01:03:09) Niika: When did the predation start?
(03/09 01:03:11) Arthur Kalnins: Another thing that's been going around... Michael Simpson mentioned in his Gahreesen review that the rock pinnacle was the first place the DRC was able to "save a link" Does this mean the DRC wrote a linking book there? If not, what does that mean?
(03/09 01:03:12) Aleks: Are all the pod ages zoo type deals?
(03/09 01:03:36) Nick White: Arthur is the journalist for the group I guess.
(03/09 01:03:41) Gondar laughs
(03/09 01:03:45) Arthur Kalnins: Of course.
(03/09 01:03:46) ireenquench laughs
(03/09 01:03:47) Kedry: Nice to meet you in person.
(03/09 01:03:54) Arthur Kalnins: Many mysteries you guys leave us.
(03/09 01:03:57) K'laamas: Shorah, ireen :)
(03/09 01:04:01) cxevalo: is the perdator a large animal or something small that could be carried by contaminated explores?
(03/09 01:04:05) Arthur Kalnins: My job to try and sort them out.
(03/09 01:04:05) Nick White: I'd have to see the context there Arthur - I don't know all of Simpson's text offhand.
(03/09 01:04:06) ireenquench: K'laamas! hi!
(03/09 01:04:24) Nick White: But I don't think he was referring to us writing a link at all.
(03/09 01:04:32) Arthur Kalnins: Can the DRC write links?
(03/09 01:04:46) Nick White: Nope.
(03/09 01:04:52) Nick White: Not that I know of at least.
(03/09 01:05:00) Niika: Are we going to be able to access the other pods anytime soon?
(03/09 01:05:01) Nick White: We aren't writing Books.
(03/09 01:05:04) Nick White: Yes.
(03/09 01:05:14) Nick White: Depending on what you mean by soon
(03/09 01:05:23) Seagull looks at watch
(03/09 01:05:24) Seagull: :)
(03/09 01:05:24) Kedry: So I missed the beginning of the conversation, but does Sharper plan on meeting us today?
(03/09 01:05:25) Aleks: What would you mean by soon?
(03/09 01:05:31) Gondar: Any groups set up trying to find out how to write as opposed to just translation? Or is it language first, advanced stuff later?
(03/09 01:05:42) Aleks: Doesn't seem so Kedry.
(03/09 01:05:47) Nick White: Right.
(03/09 01:05:48) Arthur Kalnins: Context: The rock pinnacle is "The first area since we've arrived we were able to save a link"
(03/09 01:05:51) Rils: heyya gang!
(03/09 01:05:53) Kedry: Thanks.
(03/09 01:05:57) Kedry: Rils!
(03/09 01:05:59) Kedry waves
(03/09 01:06:18) ireenquench: Hey Rils
(03/09 01:06:27) Rils waves at all 400 people in the hood
(03/09 01:07:05) Niika: Is Neghilan the DRC's biggest concern at the moment?
(03/09 01:07:16) Rils: Perhaps I missed it earlier... Nick, what evidence are finding in Negilahn as to why the animals are disappearing?
(03/09 01:07:29) Nick White: I think there are qutie a few concerns - that's one of the.
(03/09 01:07:32) Nick White: them
(03/09 01:07:53) ireenquench: Rils: Nick mentioned the predator theory again.
(03/09 01:07:59) Gondar: You did miss it Rils. They had the age set up like a zoo, and now without zookeepers the predators are runing wild. Or at least that's waht I got...
(03/09 01:08:10) Rils: any ideas what the predator is? Big? Microscopic?
(03/09 01:08:21) Arthur Kalnins: Alright.. one last question and I'll leave you alone. Where is the Ae'gura Aquarium? Where's the Arch museum for that matter?
(03/09 01:08:29) Seagull: Could it fit through the pod crack? :(
(03/09 01:08:43) Nick White: Not really... again, hopefully Sharper will give us some more information on the whole Neg thing.
(03/09 01:08:57) Kedry: When *will* we be seeing Sharper?
(03/09 01:09:00) Nick White: As far as the musuem and aquarium... confidential Arthur.
(03/09 01:09:06) Gondar: Aww!
(03/09 01:09:07) Arthur Kalnins starts to laugh
(03/09 01:09:08) Nick White: Don't want you storming the place with a video camera.
(03/09 01:09:18) Kedry roars with laughter
(03/09 01:09:20) ireenquench laughs
(03/09 01:09:25) Kedry: Or KICamera! :P
(03/09 01:09:28) Aleks: What about that new age, what it looks like and what the purpose was? Confidential also?
(03/09 01:09:30) Rils: Nick, we also have a whole group of us in the DZS who are willing to help do reaserch on the Negilahn problem!
(03/09 01:09:47) Gondar: Oh! What about the hood game room? Is it that closed door down by the water? Or somewhere we can't get to at all yet?
(03/09 01:10:19) Nick White: Looks big.
(03/09 01:10:24) Niika: Yes. Is there any way the explorer population can help the DRC out?
(03/09 01:10:28) Nick White: Purpose...maybe training of some kind?
(03/09 01:10:32) Nick White: Not quite sure yet.
(03/09 01:10:46) ireenquench: Training? Like marathon running?
(03/09 01:10:47) Aleks: Perhaps another maintaner age?
(03/09 01:11:00) Arthur Kalnins: Well since all my questions got no answers I'll have to go back on what I said... last question.. Is there any danger presented by the crack in the Negilahn pod? Any signs of what made it?
(03/09 01:11:10) Nick White: I think just time.
(03/09 01:11:22) Gondar: Phew!
(03/09 01:11:24) hailahh: Nick, this is going to sound like a dumb question, but... on the surface, we're jumping early to Daylight Saving Time on Sunday I hear. Seems like we don't need it down here! but will the cavern go to dst too?
(03/09 01:11:25) Arthur Kalnins: And anything dangerous that could get in?
(03/09 01:11:26) Nick White: No danger.
(03/09 01:11:31) Arthur Kalnins: Okay
(03/09 01:11:40) Arthur Kalnins: one for four... not bad :P
(03/09 01:11:50) Nick White: That is a good question... haven't really thought about that.
(03/09 01:11:50) Montgomery: Hey, Nick. Did you guys (DRC) get our Pento letter?
(03/09 01:11:50) Rils: Someone was trapped in there and they had to use the Jaws of Life on the Pod...
(03/09 01:11:50) Nick White: I supose Laxman would know.
(03/09 01:12:03) ireenquench: Good to hear, we have some worried explorers among us.
(03/09 01:12:29) Nick White: Pento letter?
(03/09 01:12:30) Aleks: Oh, I was wondering, anyy news on the Great Zero? Laxman would probably know more, but have you heard anything?
(03/09 01:12:36) Nick White: Not sure on that one.
(03/09 01:12:46) Nick White: Oh man, the Great Zero is a mess.
(03/09 01:12:54) Nick White: Stuff keeps breaking right when we are about to get it going.
(03/09 01:13:03) Nick White: If Laxman had any hair, he wouldn't now.
(03/09 01:13:07) Rils: blue lasers shooting everywhere...
(03/09 01:13:12) Gondar laughs
(03/09 01:13:19) Gondar: Shoot! He beat me to the line!
(03/09 01:13:24) Aleks: I see. Poor guy.
(03/09 01:13:29) Montgomery: I requested that you be on the receiving list -- Cate, Laxman, Kodama, Engberg, Sutherland and you. You didn't get it? About 2 1/2 weeks ago.
(03/09 01:13:43) ireenquench: Is it the neutrino stuff? the lattice? the Kis? what's GZs weak points?
(03/09 01:13:46) Nick White: Yeah, if you want to hear a British person say "Bloody" go hang out with Laxman.
(03/09 01:13:49) Nick White: KInda fun.
(03/09 01:13:56) Nick White: Over and over and over and over.
(03/09 01:13:59) Aleks: haha.
(03/09 01:14:07) Nick White: Not sure Montgomery.
(03/09 01:14:12) Nick White: Email?
(03/09 01:14:17) Nick White: KI Mail?
(03/09 01:14:30) Gondar: Oooh. Ouch. Hence he's not about in the caverns I guess.. and the other three are busy prepping ages as well?
(03/09 01:14:33) cxevalo: Nick does the DRC have any plans for establishing better comunications with the exploer comunity?
(03/09 01:14:37) Montgomery: Via D'net. Do you know the DRC's palns for Pento -- it being full of plague and all?
(03/09 01:14:50) Nick White: I personally haven't seen that one - sorry.
(03/09 01:14:51) Nadnerb: um..
(03/09 01:15:00) Nick White: I don't know.
(03/09 01:15:00) Arthur Kalnins: Yes, has the DRC fully checked out both Pento Ages for the plague?
(03/09 01:15:00) Nadnerb: Was he coming tonight?
(03/09 01:15:11) Nick White: As much as I do know about Sharper, I'm not his secretary.
(03/09 01:15:16) Kedry raises his hand over the crowd
(03/09 01:15:19) ireenquench roars with laughter
(03/09 01:15:24) Nadnerb starts to laugh
(03/09 01:15:24) Nick White: I said I'd be surprised if he came tonight as he is pretty busy with stuff.
(03/09 01:15:28) Rils: Is he taking applications?
(03/09 01:15:28) Nick White: But I don't know.
(03/09 01:15:32) Arthur Kalnins: Darn...
(03/09 01:15:33) Nadnerb: busy is good...
(03/09 01:15:39) Kedry: Can you tell us Mr. Sharper's KI#?
(03/09 01:15:42) Nadnerb: It means things are happening
(03/09 01:15:46) Nick White: No I can not.
(03/09 01:15:54) Kedry: Shoot. :P
(03/09 01:16:20) Arthur Kalnins: Nick: Are you still passing out Delins?
(03/09 01:16:23) Dav'on: I wouldn't think Sharper would want to be constantly pestered by explorers wanting to know things.
(03/09 01:16:44) Kedry: But while we're at it, what's your opinion on sharing DRC KI#s in forums?
(03/09 01:16:57) Nick White: My personal opinion? Seems fine to me.
(03/09 01:17:04) Nick White: Alright boys and girls.
(03/09 01:17:09) Nick White: I gotta run.
(03/09 01:17:10) Gondar: Quick! Start plastering numbers! :-D
(03/09 01:17:19) Arthur Kalnins: Nick, before you leave...
(03/09 01:17:19) Kedry: Thanks!
(03/09 01:17:20) Arthur Kalnins: Are you still passing out Delins?
(03/09 01:17:21) Mystlander goes to throw herself off the classroom roof into the lake
(03/09 01:17:23) Aleks salutes
(03/09 01:17:24) Gondar: Thanks for dropping by Nick!
(03/09 01:17:30) ireenquench: Bye Nick, thanks for stopping by.
(03/09 01:17:33) Kedry: See you around.
(03/09 01:17:33) Dav'on waves goodbye
(03/09 01:17:33) Nick White: Don't have any on me.. sorry Arthur.
(03/09 01:17:33) Gondar: Oooh Delin..
(03/09 01:17:34) Niika: It was great talking to you Nick :)
(03/09 01:17:34) Aleks: Have a good one.
(03/09 01:17:36) Keera: thanks Nick
(03/09 01:17:38) Arthur Kalnins: Okay, thanks
(03/09 01:17:40) Gondar: Too bad.
(03/09 01:17:41) Montgomery: Nick, sorry to persist, but quite a few of us are very concerned about the possibility of plague coming from Pento -- which is on the DRC list. Do you know if it is safe, and the DRC's plans for Pento?
(03/09 01:17:52) Xanos: Thanks Nick
(03/09 01:17:52) Seagull: Thanks, Nick. :)
(03/09 01:18:17) Nick White: I wouldn't worry about the Pento plague....
(03/09 01:18:18) Nadnerb: bye nick, shorah
(03/09 01:18:21) Nick White: I think it'll be fine.
(03/09 01:18:32) Arthur Kalnins: Have the DRC checked it fully?
(03/09 01:18:36) Kedry: Pento: The new cavern ceiling... :)
(03/09 01:18:37) Nick White: No.
(03/09 01:18:42) Nick White: Exactly.
(03/09 01:18:48) Montgomery: Great, Nick. Thank you -- this is the first answer we have been able to get.
(03/09 01:18:50) Gondar: Now how do I make money selling breathing masks to stop the plague? ;-)
(03/09 01:18:55) Nick White: But that's why it's not open to anyone.
(03/09 01:18:57) tweetie: I hope so, I don't want to get sick and die before I hit my prime time of life
(03/09 01:19:00) Arthur Kalnins: Ah okay
(03/09 01:19:04) Arthur Kalnins: Good to know.
(03/09 01:19:05) Nick White: Good point Gondar.
(03/09 01:19:09) Nick White: Hmmm...
(03/09 01:19:17) Nick White: Alright, I'm outta here.
(03/09 01:19:19) Montgomery: Nick, do you know where they found the Pento book?
(03/09 01:19:20) Gondar: Oop. Surprised Cate didn't try it yet..
(03/09 01:19:20) Kedry laughs
(03/09 01:19:21) tweetie: bye
(03/09 01:19:25) Aleks: Peace.
(03/09 01:19:27) hailahh: bye!
(03/09 01:19:29) Gondar: Bye!
(03/09 01:19:29) Kedry: See you 'round.
(03/09 01:19:32) Nadnerb: shorah
