(03/28 20:33:07) Vivicus: what have you been working on, mr Engberg?
(03/28 20:33:22) Michael Engberg: Things are even tighter than usual on the DRC with Ms. Sutherland being on the surface so long.
(03/28 20:33:39) ireenquench waves hello
(03/28 20:33:50) TomahnaGuy: shorah all
(03/28 20:33:52) Michael Engberg: So we're all trying to pitch in and cover her duties as well.
(03/28 20:33:56) Teknobubba: Tighter? As in higher security?
(03/28 20:34:01) Tela: Hello TG
(03/28 20:34:02) TomahnaGuy waves hello
(03/28 20:34:20) Michael Engberg: tighter as in schedules.
(03/28 20:34:24) Teknobubba: Ah.
(03/28 20:34:35) TomahnaGuy: How have things been going Mr Engberg?
(03/28 20:34:37) Teknobubba: Interruptions interupting the interruptions.
(03/28 20:34:54) TomahnaGuy: Restoration wise
(03/28 20:35:00) Michael Engberg: but the restoration of the latest Age, Minkata, is going very well.
(03/28 20:35:09) Teknobubba: Excellent.
(03/28 20:35:12) ireenquench: Nick mentioned personal reasons for Marie's absence the other day, sure this doesnt have to do with the restoration? Her being away?
(03/28 20:35:16) TomahnaGuy: Oh yes, Mintake - what does it look like?
(03/28 20:35:34) Teknobubba: How is it pronounced?
(03/28 20:35:39) ireenquench worries about Marie
(03/28 20:36:23) Michael Engberg: Ireen, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective her absence has nothing to do with the restoration. Personal matters on the surface.
(03/28 20:36:36) TomahnaGuy: is she well?
(03/28 20:37:13) Michael Engberg: She is fine, but for her own privacy, I'll let her decide what she releases to the explorers.
(03/28 20:37:21) TomahnaGuy: Heh ok
(03/28 20:37:27) TomahnaGuy: Give her oir regards
(03/28 20:37:31) TomahnaGuy: Our
(03/28 20:37:34) Michael Engberg: But to stick to more pleasant topics...

(03/28 20:37:51) pocketpie: 1
(03/28 20:37:54) ireenquench: Minkata means "heavily scarred" ?
(03/28 20:38:11) ireenquench: not that that sounds very pleasant :S
(03/28 20:38:14) Michael Engberg: The main reason I came today was to thank all of the explorers who have contributed to the Eder Tsogal stained glass project.
(03/28 20:38:25) TomahnaGuy: Oh i ded
(03/28 20:38:28) TomahnaGuy: Did

(03/28 20:44:31) ireenquench: Great, thanks... btw, any idea how long it will take for the ResEngs to put up the Tsogahl ones?
(03/28 20:45:03) Jazz: How many will there be?
(03/28 20:46:04) Michael Engberg: Ireen, I am not sure. I would guess two to three months.
