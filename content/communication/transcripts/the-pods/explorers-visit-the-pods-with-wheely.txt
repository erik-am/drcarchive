(03/15 19:08:04) Carl Palmner: I know, isn't it cool?
(03/15 19:08:37) Wheely: this is amazing
(03/15 19:08:44) Carl Palmner: I haven't seen any animals up above, but there are some really cool sea creatures down below.
(03/15 19:09:13) Wheely: hi gadren. this is so cool
(03/15 19:09:19) Carl Palmner nods his head
(03/15 19:09:27) Wheely: what does the button do?
(03/15 19:09:40) Carl Palmner: Turns on a light, I think.
(03/15 19:09:58) Carl Palmner: Down below you can see fish and stingrays
(03/15 19:10:13) Wheely: there's more up the ladder?
(03/15 19:10:23) Carl Palmner: Yeah, and down the other
(03/15 19:10:47) Carl Palmner: Gad--don't forget about the power. I assume its solar
(03/15 19:11:00) Sam Byard: shorah
(03/15 19:11:03) Carl Palmner: hi sam
(03/15 19:11:03) Wheely (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(03/15 19:11:14) Wheely: Wow!
(03/15 19:11:15) Gadren: hi sam!
(03/15 19:11:25) Wheely: this is great!
(03/15 19:11:33) Carl Palmner: The stingray things are awesome huh!
(03/15 19:11:39) Wheely: is the other museum age like this?
(03/15 19:11:51) Carl Palmner: Sort of
(03/15 19:11:52) Gadren: Kind of -- the animals don't appear as much
(03/15 19:12:01) Carl Palmner: The pod is the same, the Age is way different
(03/15 19:12:03) Carl Palmner: All plants
(03/15 19:12:05) Sam Byard: well we dont know that this is all the animals
(03/15 19:12:28) Carl Palmner: There are two different kinds of stingrays
(03/15 19:13:01) Carl Palmner: What has your dad told you about Dereno, Wheely?
(03/15 19:13:08) Carl Palmner: Hi Tom!
(03/15 19:13:12) Wheely: Not much
(03/15 19:13:13) BiGToM: hey
(03/15 19:13:23) BiGToM waves hello
(03/15 19:13:38) Gadren: shorah bigtom!
(03/15 19:13:51) Wheely: i'm sure he's worried that it will bust a leak
(03/15 19:13:59) Carl Palmner: Haha probably
(03/15 19:14:06) Sam Byard: basically what i have found is that there aren't any animals in the immediate vicinity that respond to the sounds emmited by the pod
(03/15 19:14:06) Carl Palmner: I like your dad, I want to meet him sometime.
(03/15 19:14:12) Wheely: what about all these buttons?
(03/15 19:14:25) Sam Byard: Wheely these buttons send out animal sounds
(03/15 19:14:27) Carl Palmner: I don't know Sam, I think one might affect the bug-eyed stingrays
(03/15 19:14:43) Sam Byard: It's possible they attract animals to the pod
(03/15 19:14:45) Wheely: what about the big one?
(03/15 19:14:53) Sam Byard: the big one is the main power for the pod
(03/15 19:14:57) Carl Palmner: Oh dont touch that one Wheely
(03/15 19:15:02) Carl Palmner: We'll all be in the dark :)
(03/15 19:15:03) Wheely: okay
(03/15 19:15:10) Wheely: seriously?
(03/15 19:15:14) Carl Palmner: You are too young to be in a dark pod with a bunch of guys.
(03/15 19:15:18) Sam Byard: the windows get pretty cloudy if you switch that one off
(03/15 19:15:20) Wheely: ha
(03/15 19:15:32) Wheely: cool sounds
(03/15 19:15:32) Gadren: remind me to turn off the power when we leave -- the power isn't infinite
(03/15 19:15:37) BiGToM: those by the windows seams to light up more outside
(03/15 19:15:58) Carl Palmner: Yeah right now the bug-eyed stingrays are definitely c loser
(03/15 19:15:59) Gadren (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(03/15 19:16:02) Carl Palmner: Which sound is on?
(03/15 19:16:10) Carl Palmner: Is it number 3?
(03/15 19:16:35) Sam Byard: what is the number on the floor ?
(03/15 19:16:43) Carl Palmner: I don't know
(03/15 19:16:45) Gadren: That's the D'ni 25
(03/15 19:16:45) Sam Byard: is it 10 ?
(03/15 19:16:48) Carl Palmner: No
(03/15 19:16:49) Sam Byard: 25
(03/15 19:16:54) Sam Byard: ok hmm
(03/15 19:16:55) Carl Palmner: Your thinking roman numerals
(03/15 19:17:00) Sam Byard: the other pod has 13 yes ?
(03/15 19:17:05) Carl Palmner: No, 18
(03/15 19:17:10) Sam Byard: oh :S
(03/15 19:17:12) Carl Palmner: I think it's just a pod number
(03/15 19:17:17) Carl Palmner: not puzzle-relatewd
(03/15 19:17:31) Sam Byard: possibly, not that anything is DESIGNED to be a puzzle
(03/15 19:17:34) Carl Palmner: Are you guys still hearing the button's sound?
(03/15 19:17:38) Gadren: ack!
(03/15 19:17:40) Carl Palmner nods his head
(03/15 19:17:41) Sam Byard: ok thats the power
(03/15 19:17:43) Wheely: Hey!
(03/15 19:17:49) Carl Palmner: Wow
(03/15 19:17:56) Carl Palmner: We don't get much time here huh?
(03/15 19:17:57) Wheely: That was cool!
(03/15 19:18:11) Sam Byard: ok your power is run out
(03/15 19:18:11) Gadren: this is kind of creepy
(03/15 19:18:13) Carl Palmner: Sorry Gad, looks like your drained.
(03/15 19:18:14) Gadren: i guess so
(03/15 19:18:15) Sam Byard: my pod has power
(03/15 19:18:19) Gadren: that went out fast
(03/15 19:18:20) Sam Byard: anyone wanna move ?
(03/15 19:18:24) Wheely: is it broken?
(03/15 19:18:32) Carl Palmner: No, the power is out.
(03/15 19:18:33) Sam Byard: the pods are solar powered wheely
(03/15 19:18:36) Carl Palmner: It jhas limited time
(03/15 19:18:39) Resolute Guardian waves hello
(03/15 19:18:40) Sam Byard: only a short battery life
(03/15 19:18:48) Carl Palmner: Still...the sun is still out.
(03/15 19:18:57) Carl Palmner: You'd think it wouldn't need to recharge until night
(03/15 19:19:02) Wheely: does it get night here?
(03/15 19:19:08) Carl Palmner shrugs
(03/15 19:19:12) Carl Palmner: Who kjnows?
(03/15 19:19:13) Sam Byard: we dont know yet
(03/15 19:19:17) Sam Byard: its possible
(03/15 19:19:20) Gadren: we can always go to someone else's dereno...but have fun handling the invites ;)
(03/15 19:19:23) Sam Byard: it does in negilahn
(03/15 19:19:25) Carl Palmner: shorah Guardian
(03/15 19:19:28) Gadren: we should do something before we freeze
(03/15 19:19:33) Sam Byard: i can relto invite you all to mine ?
(03/15 19:19:35) Gadren: shorah RG
(03/15 19:19:37) BiGToM: why dont we try out the Eder tsogal age?
(03/15 19:19:46) Carl Palmner: Ok Sam, I'm game
(03/15 19:19:51) Sam Byard: everyone up for a relto invite to mine ?
(03/15 19:19:54) Wheely: i haven't been to negilahn either. that's the other museum age?
(03/15 19:19:55) Gadren: sorry RG, our power's gone
(03/15 19:19:56) Sam Byard: wheely that ok with you ?
(03/15 19:20:01) Sam Byard: ok lets go to my negilahn
(03/15 19:20:07) Gadren: ok :)
(03/15 19:20:07) Carl Palmner: Neg works
(03/15 19:20:09) Wheely: ok
(03/15 19:20:10) Gadren cheers
(03/15 19:20:12) Gadren: warmer too
(03/15 19:20:19) Player added.
(03/15 19:20:26) Resolute Guardian: maybe if we all hold our breaths, the window won't be so foggy... :)
(03/15 19:20:39) To Cate Alexander: Thanks for Dereno, Cate. You don't know me, but I just wanted to say thanks!
(03/15 19:20:44) Sam Byard: coming ?
(03/15 19:20:54) From Cate Alexander in D'ni-Ae'gura: You are welcome!
(03/15 19:21:22) Sam Byard: line up
[Note: The group links to Relto and continues to Negilahn.]
(03/15 19:21:55) Chat.log started...
(03/15 19:22:01) Gadren: do you know where that Relto Page is?
(03/15 19:22:05) Wheely: no
(03/15 19:22:25) Carl Palmner: Sorry guys, the logs tend to make me crash so I'll hide in here.
(03/15 19:22:27) Gadren: It's in a strange, alternate-future like version of the Kadish vault
(03/15 19:22:32) Carl Palmner: (And sorry for the completely OOC comment there...)
(03/15 19:22:42) Gadren: I guess we'll have to wait for Sam to open us up
(03/15 19:22:52) Sam Byard: hey
(03/15 19:22:52) Gadren: Hi Sam!
(03/15 19:22:56) Gadren: can you open us up?
(03/15 19:23:00) Sam Byard: yeah sure
(03/15 19:23:06) Sam Byard: where are we headed
(03/15 19:23:10) Sam Byard: negilahn ?
(03/15 19:23:29) BiGToM: where did you get those butterflies??
(03/15 19:23:30) Wheely: yes
(03/15 19:23:31) Sam Byard: or my dereno ?
(03/15 19:23:37) Sam Byard: ok negilahn it is
(03/15 19:23:41) Wheely: negilahn
(03/15 19:23:47) Sam Byard: the books open
(03/15 19:23:49) Carl Palmner: Tom--the alternate Kadish Vault I think
(03/15 19:23:52) Gadren: ladies first
(03/15 19:24:02) BiGToM: cool
(03/15 19:24:05) Resolute Guardian seems strangely compelled to stay frozen at the link in spot
(03/15 19:24:06) Carl Palmner: I'll let someone else be second this time
(03/15 19:24:11) Carl Palmner: Just dont forget to /startlog
(03/15 19:24:11) Gadren (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(03/15 19:24:11) Sam Byard (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(03/15 19:24:37) Carl Palmner: Negilahn, Guardian
(03/15 19:24:43) Resolute Guardian: ok :)
(03/15 19:25:10) Wheely: cool
(03/15 19:25:18) Wheely: this is great too!
(03/15 19:25:19) Carl Palmner: Already powered eh?
(03/15 19:25:31) Gadren: i just flipped it on
(03/15 19:25:38) Carl Palmner: It's pretty but it gets old if you never see an animal--and I have yet to see one :(
(03/15 19:25:41) Carl Palmner: Ah
(03/15 19:25:55) Carl Palmner: Guardian had just arrived on Relto when I left
(03/15 19:25:57) Sam Byard: welcome to negilahn wheely
(03/15 19:25:57) Wheely: what kind of animals?
(03/15 19:26:08) Wheely: thanks sam
(03/15 19:26:11) Sam Byard: guardian will be ok, its the only book i shared
(03/15 19:26:13) Gadren: one's a monkey-looking thing with suction cups on its fingers
(03/15 19:26:24) Carl Palmner: Well there's a tiny two-tailed monkey and a giant crazy bird
(03/15 19:26:30) Gadren: and then there's a giant bird-like thing called an urwin
(03/15 19:26:53) Carl Palmner: This is the one people most commonly see animals from Wheely
(03/15 19:27:09) Wheely: will they come if we wait?
(03/15 19:27:13) Carl Palmner shrugs
(03/15 19:27:15) Sam Byard: there is a predator out there eating the rest of the animals
(03/15 19:27:18) Carl Palmner: THey never have for me.
(03/15 19:27:19) Sam Byard: they will come
(03/15 19:27:22) Carl Palmner: But for some they have
(03/15 19:27:28) Sam Byard: but they have a very regular feeding cycle
(03/15 19:27:32) Wheely: i hear something
(03/15 19:27:33) Carl Palmner: So maybe if I leave, you'll get to see them lol
(03/15 19:27:37) Sam Byard: its about 10 hours before the urwin is due
(03/15 19:27:37) Gadren: yah -- there's a chart in the ae'gura museum showing other animals, but no one has seen the others
(03/15 19:27:40) Wheely: ha!
(03/15 19:27:43) Carl Palmner: Eh?
(03/15 19:27:51) Carl Palmner: They're on a time schedule?
(03/15 19:28:06) Sam Byard: they have very predictable migratory routes
(03/15 19:28:12) Carl Palmner: Huh
(03/15 19:28:17) Carl Palmner: What about the monkeys?
(03/15 19:28:22) Sam Byard: back me up on this one Gadren
(03/15 19:28:26) Gadren: heh
(03/15 19:28:32) Gadren: I've never seen an animal in person
(03/15 19:28:32) Wheely: predictable, so you know when they're coming
(03/15 19:28:41) Sam Byard: the monkey also seems to have a pattern to his movements
(03/15 19:28:45) Sam Byard: yes Wheely
(03/15 19:28:50) Carl Palmner: Heh...Gadren, from right here, it looks like you have Wheely's ponytail.
(03/15 19:29:08) Sam Byard: some explorers have studied thier patterns over a long period
(03/15 19:29:16) Gadren: I hope the predator issue is resolved soon -- there's this one I want to see; it's like a gorilla with a scorpion tail
(03/15 19:29:17) Carl Palmner: The DZS eh?
(03/15 19:29:20) Sam Byard: and we not can accurately predict what time they come
(03/15 19:29:22) Carl Palmner: Yeah!
(03/15 19:29:27) Carl Palmner: I want to see that one too!
(03/15 19:29:29) Wheely: how close do they get?
(03/15 19:29:51) Sam Byard: I'm afraid i cant tell you that i haven't witnessed them myself
(03/15 19:29:54) Carl Palmner: I think the monkey gets pretty close.
(03/15 19:29:54) Sam Byard: Gadren, any input ?
(03/15 19:29:58) Carl Palmner starts to laugh
(03/15 19:29:59) Gadren shrugs
(03/15 19:30:07) Carl Palmner: No one here has ever seen a Neg animal.
(03/15 19:30:14) Gadren: Zoology isn't my specialty
(03/15 19:30:17) Wheely: no one!
(03/15 19:30:26) Gadren: Living things are an enigma
(03/15 19:30:29) Carl Palmner: Well, no one currently in this pod anyway
(03/15 19:30:30) Sam Byard: Only pictures Wheely
(03/15 19:30:39) Wheely: ah
(03/15 19:30:41) Carl Palmner: I saw a video of the Urwin
(03/15 19:30:50) Gadren: me too
(03/15 19:30:52) Carl Palmner: Someone brought a video camera when they linked in, and filmed it walking.
(03/15 19:31:07) Wheely: something is blinking out there
(03/15 19:31:16) Gadren: I see it too
(03/15 19:31:16) Carl Palmner: Yeah! You see that too huh?
(03/15 19:31:22) Wheely: what is that?
(03/15 19:31:26) Gadren shrugs
(03/15 19:31:28) Carl Palmner: We don't know.
(03/15 19:31:39) Wheely: eyes!!
(03/15 19:31:39) Carl Palmner: Someone asked Sharper if he'd look into it, but he pretty much said no.
(03/15 19:31:41) Wheely: :)
(03/15 19:31:43) Carl Palmner starts to laugh
(03/15 19:31:48) Wheely: whoa
(03/15 19:31:55) Wheely: what was that noise?
(03/15 19:32:01) Gadren: which one?
(03/15 19:32:04) Wheely: like a monkey
(03/15 19:32:08) Carl Palmner: I don't hear anything but frogs
(03/15 19:32:12) Wheely: or something
(03/15 19:32:16) Sam Byard: I did press the monkey button
(03/15 19:32:24) Sam Byard: come down the stairs and try it yourself wheely :)
(03/15 19:32:25) Wheely: oh okay
(03/15 19:32:37) Carl Palmner: That crack really does scare me
(03/15 19:32:57) Sam Byard: these four buttons here
(03/15 19:32:59) Carl Palmner: I guess the DRC have approved the Age and all...still, I wonder if we should have a kid down here.
(03/15 19:32:59) Wheely (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(03/15 19:33:31) Gadren: Well, Relto is alwaya a link away
(03/15 19:33:32) Sam Byard: there is enough of us Carl to link wheely out if the predetor comes calling
(03/15 19:33:44) Carl Palmner: Good point.
(03/15 19:33:53) Carl Palmner: I guess I just happen to share her dad's paranoia :)
(03/15 19:34:33) Carl Palmner: Wheely you do have your own Relto book right?
(03/15 19:34:50) Wheely: there are bugs out there
(03/15 19:34:54) Wheely: at least
(03/15 19:35:01) Wheely: glowing bugs
(03/15 19:35:09) Wheely: like in the garden
(03/15 19:35:16) Wheely: yeah
(03/15 19:35:33) Gadren: interesting that on seperate Ages there would be a similar creature
(03/15 19:35:37) ResEng B Drechsel says hey
(03/15 19:35:46) Wheely: because they stick to people!
(03/15 19:35:48) Wheely: :)
(03/15 19:35:52) Carl Palmner: Wha?
(03/15 19:35:53) BiGToM (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(03/15 19:35:54) Sam Byard: Drechsel ?
(03/15 19:35:59) Carl Palmner: "ResEng B Drechsel says hey"
(03/15 19:36:01) Gadren: That's odd
(03/15 19:36:03) Sam Byard: you dont have your KI on
(03/15 19:36:04) Carl Palmner: But he's not here...
(03/15 19:36:12) Gadren: He's not here or on my KI
(03/15 19:36:13) Wheely: you know, you can link with them
(03/15 19:36:20) ResEng B Drechsel: Sorry, not trying to scare anyone :)
(03/15 19:36:26) Carl Palmner: With what Wheely
(03/15 19:36:31) Sam Byard: Wheely i think the fireflies must have linked here with an original d'ni
(03/15 19:36:36) Carl Palmner: Drechsel? Are you a ghost?
(03/15 19:36:41) ResEng B Drechsel: I goofed up my KI unsticking people in the museum...
(03/15 19:36:44) Sam Byard: and taken root in this environment
(03/15 19:37:09) Carl Palmner: LOL. So now your a ghost eh?
(03/15 19:37:12) Wheely: who is B Drechsel?
(03/15 19:37:15) Carl Palmner: What brings you to Negilahn?
(03/15 19:37:16) Gadren: Maybe the ResEngs have a global message function that was accidentally turned on
(03/15 19:37:29) Resolute Guardian: B Drechsel just got me unstuck from the link in point :)
(03/15 19:37:35) Carl Palmner: Ahhhhhh
(03/15 19:37:35) Sam Byard: Drechsel is an engineer that works with your dad wheely
(03/15 19:37:38) Wheely: where is b drechsel?
(03/15 19:37:44) Gadren: Dreschel's one of the ResEngs -- cool guy
(03/15 19:37:48) Resolute Guardian: he was in Sam's Relto last I saw
(03/15 19:37:57) Gadren: I don't think he's here
(03/15 19:38:04) Carl Palmner: Hey Guardian--whats hsi KI?
(03/15 19:38:07) ResEng B Drechsel: Nice to meet you, Wheely
(03/15 19:38:11) Carl Palmner: I need a ResEng KI or two
(03/15 19:38:17) Gadren: 816804
(03/15 19:38:17) ResEng B Drechsel: 816804
(03/15 19:38:19) Wheely: nice to meet you B
(03/15 19:38:21) Carl Palmner: thanks

(03/15 19:39:05) Gadren: hee
(03/15 19:39:09) Wheely: safe from what?
(03/15 19:39:15) Sam Byard: there is a predator
(03/15 19:39:16) BiGToM: well i gtg now, fun to explore with you all. :)
(03/15 19:39:28) Sam Byard: You met douglas sharper ?
(03/15 19:39:29) Gadren: see ya, BiGToM!
(03/15 19:39:35) Resolute Guardian: bye BigToM
(03/15 19:39:36) BiGToM: bye
(03/15 19:39:51) Carl Palmner: Sorry guys
(03/15 19:40:06) Carl Palmner: I think something in the air here was making me dizzy
(03/15 19:40:06) Sam Byard (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(03/15 19:40:08) Carl Palmner: Better now
(03/15 19:40:14) Gadren: It's interesting how you don't show up on the KI list, Mr. ResEng :)
(03/15 19:40:34) Carl Palmner: Yeah, but he does show up on my Buddy List as being in Negilahn
(03/15 19:40:42) Sam Byard: Mr. SHarper is going to hunt the predator Wheely
(03/15 19:40:56) Sam Byard: Him and Mr. White and Mr. Rils
(03/15 19:40:59) Wheely: i heard he wasn't going to kill it
(03/15 19:41:02) Wheely: right?
(03/15 19:41:11) Sam Byard: Knowing him it's quite likely
(03/15 19:41:11) Gadren: I'm not sure -- I hope so
(03/15 19:41:13) Carl Palmner: Really? Hmmm. Not what I heard.
(03/15 19:41:25) Carl Palmner: Personally I'd prefer it captured and kept somewhere
(03/15 19:41:27) Wheely: they better not! I will be MAD!
(03/15 19:41:30) Sam Byard: However
(03/15 19:41:42) Carl Palmner: But Wheely
(03/15 19:41:56) Carl Palmner: If they don't kill it, the other animals here will continue to die
(03/15 19:42:05) Carl Palmner: Unless of course they can somehow capture it.
(03/15 19:42:08) Sam Byard: Surely (maybe you can help me here Drechsel) its againt DRC policy to kill native species of the ages they visit
(03/15 19:42:17) Wheely: it kills the other animals?
(03/15 19:42:20) Wheely: what is it?
(03/15 19:42:20) Sam Byard: sort of a DRC "Prime directive"
(03/15 19:42:21) Carl Palmner: Thats right
(03/15 19:42:25) Carl Palmner: We don't know.
(03/15 19:42:27) Sam Byard: We dont know Wheely
(03/15 19:42:28) Resolute Guardian: who said It can even be killed...
(03/15 19:42:41) Gadren: For some reason, in the past few weeks, the population has dropped greatly
(03/15 19:42:43) ResEng B Drechsel: Well, nice to meet you all, I have to run...
(03/15 19:42:44) Carl Palmner: Ok ok let's not scare the kid
(03/15 19:42:46) Wheely: you mean nobody has seen it?
(03/15 19:42:50) Gadren: Nope
(03/15 19:42:54) Sam Byard: not yet Wheely
(03/15 19:42:54) Carl Palmner: Bye Drechsel! Thanks for the KI #!
(03/15 19:42:55) Resolute Guardian: see ya Mr Drechsel
(03/15 19:42:56) Wheely: weird
(03/15 19:42:56) Gadren: See ya, Mr. Dreschel!
(03/15 19:43:04) Resolute Guardian: thanks for getting my feet unstuck :)
(03/15 19:43:05) Carl Palmner: It never comes near the pod.
(03/15 19:43:06) ResEng B Drechsel: The "sticky" Dereno book in the museum is a killer :)
(03/15 19:43:07) Wheely: bye ResEng guy
(03/15 19:43:16) ResEng B Drechsel: Bye all :)
(03/15 19:43:40) Sam Byard: bye
(03/15 19:43:53) Sam Byard: Wheely anything else you want to know
(03/15 19:44:05) Wheely: I keep thinking i'm going to see something!
(03/15 19:44:06) Sam Byard: I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have
(03/15 19:44:14) Sam Byard: Well
(03/15 19:44:26) Sam Byard: If you want i can tell you the next time they are coming ?
(03/15 19:45:04) Wheely: how do you know they're coming?
(03/15 19:45:09) Carl Palmner shrugs
(03/15 19:45:11) Gadren: that's interesting...I never noticed that the D'ni number was also on the ceiling
(03/15 19:45:15) Sam Byard: WE studied thier migratory routes
(03/15 19:45:17) Carl Palmner: I must admit I prefer Dereno
(03/15 19:45:43) Carl Palmner: How the heck did that crack happen anyway?
(03/15 19:45:55) Wheely: Oh yeah. It's on the floor and ceiling
(03/15 19:45:58) Sam Byard: Possibly thermal tensoin
(03/15 19:46:08) Gadren: I wonder how they got these pods in these Ages -- were they able to mass-link it somehow or did they build it up?
(03/15 19:46:11) Sam Byard: heating and cooling over the years
(03/15 19:46:20) Carl Palmner: And with a vine growing down it--it's like this pod is ages old (no pun intended) and yet I thought the DRC built them.
(03/15 19:46:30) Sam Byard: and splitting a fault in the pod
(03/15 19:46:56) Wheely: is it cracked or something?
(03/15 19:47:01) Carl Palmner: I think I read Sharper saying somewhere that the DRC put the pods here.
(03/15 19:47:01) Sam Byard: yes wheely
(03/15 19:47:08) Carl Palmner: Yes Wheely, but just a small one at the top.
(03/15 19:47:08) Sam Byard: follow me to the top level
(03/15 19:47:11) Gadren: No, the pods were built by the D'ni
(03/15 19:47:12) Carl Palmner: Well, sort of small...
(03/15 19:47:21) Carl Palmner: I guess one of the monkeys could get in here if they wanted to.
(03/15 19:47:33) Wheely: that big of a crack?
(03/15 19:47:40) Carl Palmner: Heh heh...hey Wheely, want a pet monkey? :P
(03/15 19:47:40) Sam Byard: definately
(03/15 19:47:46) Gadren: Well, I need to be heading out...
(03/15 19:47:50) Gadren: This has been great
(03/15 19:47:53) Carl Palmner: Yeah. Not big enough for something like an Urwin though
(03/15 19:47:54) Gadren: Thanks for coming, Wheely!
(03/15 19:47:59) Resolute Guardian: bye Gadren
(03/15 19:48:00) Carl Palmner: I gotta go as well.
(03/15 19:48:08) Sam Byard: behind you Wheely
(03/15 19:48:08) Carl Palmner: Wheely, it was really great to meet you!
(03/15 19:48:18) Sam Byard: On the wall
(03/15 19:48:19) Resolute Guardian: Bye Carl
(03/15 19:48:20) Wheely: sure. thanks for showing me. i want to make sure i have these books now!
(03/15 19:48:25) Carl Palmner: Tell your dad I'm glad someone so cautious is on the DRC, and I'd love to meet him sometime.
(03/15 19:48:36) Carl Palmner salutes
(03/15 19:48:37) Sam Byard: I can show you where to find them if you want Wheely
