(03/03 18:36:23) Devokan: Whats going on Nick? Do you know you set the linking book out?
(03/03 18:36:33) TomahnaGuy: Are the DRC okay with this? Or are they ballistic?
(03/03 18:36:35) Devokan: *who
(03/03 18:36:55) Nick White: They aren't real happy. The Book hasn't been approved.
(03/03 18:36:58) Nick White: But....
(03/03 18:37:07) Dan'nee: That might explain a few things.
(03/03 18:37:07) Justin (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(03/03 18:37:19) Babylonian: such as?
(03/03 18:37:22) Nick White: Just trying to figure out how it all happened.
(03/03 18:37:33) Poutrew: How do I get the book?
(03/03 18:37:33) TomahnaGuy: Yeah its not very high on the age list
(03/03 18:37:33) TomahnaGuy: Must be still unsafe
(03/03 18:37:36) Nick White: Right.
(03/03 18:37:40) TomahnaGuy: im gald we're all safe
(03/03 18:37:47) TomahnaGuy: *glad
(03/03 18:38:01) ian1: Lets hope nobody linked there
(03/03 18:38:03) Whilyam: You think Sharper is involved with this?
(03/03 18:38:09) Devokan: dereno is set for final approval though, so it gotta be at least mostly safe
(03/03 18:38:14) Dan'nee: Well, Yeesha must be involved.
(03/03 18:38:15) Babylonian: Who is Sharper?
(03/03 18:38:16) Nick White: If you see ShellShock, ask him not to share it anymore.
(03/03 18:38:18) TomahnaGuy: It looked kinda safe
(03/03 18:38:23) TomahnaGuy: Sure
(03/03 18:38:26) TomahnaGuy: Also
(03/03 18:38:51) TomahnaGuy: There were creaking sounds at times as thoguh the age was loosing its integrity
(03/03 18:39:04) Nick White: Yeah just not a good idea to go there yet....
(03/03 18:39:09) Nick White: I suppose.
(03/03 18:39:10) TomahnaGuy: Yep
(03/03 18:39:25) TomahnaGuy: ill tell shellshock not to send any more invites
(03/03 18:39:31) ian1: Any idea when it will be opened to the public?
(03/03 18:39:39) TomahnaGuy: Officially :P
(03/03 18:39:46) Babylonian: Has anyone seen Shellshock?
(03/03 18:39:49) TomahnaGuy: Yes
(03/03 18:39:51) Dan'nee: Nick, you mentioned something before about animals being somewhat absent?
(03/03 18:39:54) TomahnaGuy: He left Dereno earlier
(03/03 18:40:16) Dan'nee: Does the DRC know of predators in the area of Negilahn?
(03/03 18:40:32) Whilyam: So, Nick, what happened to Sharper? He came back last night, is he going to come out in public today?
(03/03 18:40:40) Nick White: Alright... so lots of questions and only a few minutes.
(03/03 18:40:55) Nick White: Negilahn... something is taking out the animals.
(03/03 18:40:59) TomahnaGuy: Apparently im not llowed to say about the age
(03/03 18:41:01) Nick White: I don't know what it is but it's outside the pod.
(03/03 18:41:08) TomahnaGuy: Ohh
(03/03 18:41:09) Nick White: Dereno.. don't go there.
(03/03 18:41:14) TomahnaGuy: Could it harm us?
(03/03 18:41:22) Nick White: If you see Shell Shock tell him not to share it.
(03/03 18:41:23) Phatcat: Shorah
(03/03 18:41:28) TomahnaGuy: Yep
(03/03 18:41:31) Nick White: Sharper... he's meeting with the DRC right now.
(03/03 18:41:34) TomahnaGuy: Whats wrong with Dereno?
(03/03 18:41:36) Nick White: Trying to make some ammends.
(03/03 18:41:58) Babylonian: What do you think the DRC will do to him?
(03/03 18:42:02) Nick White: See if he can't help the DRC... which given the weird Neg stuff, who knows....
(03/03 18:42:14) Nick White: That's about all I know.
(03/03 18:42:20) Whilyam: Might he come by today?
(03/03 18:42:21) TomahnaGuy: What about Dereno? whats wrong with it?
(03/03 18:42:24) Nick White: Well, not really but all I'm going to talk about.

(03/03 18:42:28) rilrov: He going to go on a preditor hunting trip :P
(03/03 18:42:32) Nick White: Nothing is wrong but it hasn't been released.
(03/03 18:42:37) TomahnaGuy: Okay
(03/03 18:42:37) Nick White: Therefore, people shouldn't go there.
(03/03 18:42:48) Nick White: Ideally.
(03/03 18:42:49) TomahnaGuy: Its just unlick that we did
(03/03 18:42:56) Dan'nee: Was it like, sitting around somewhere the DRC didn't expect?
(03/03 18:42:57) Survivor: hello people
(03/03 18:43:12) TomahnaGuy: Btw Nick
(03/03 18:43:15) Dan'nee: Shorah, Survivor.
(03/03 18:43:18) steve van cleef: Ideally ? that was a bit vague
(03/03 18:43:19) Nick White: I have no idea how Shell Shock got the Book... weird Bahro stuff... he stole it.
(03/03 18:43:25) Nick White: I don't knwo.
(03/03 18:43:28) Dan'nee: Oh
(03/03 18:43:28) Nick White: or know.
(03/03 18:43:30) TomahnaGuy: He said bahro
(03/03 18:43:38) TomahnaGuy: On the ceiling
(03/03 18:43:39) Dan'nee: steve, he meant ideally we shouldn't go to Dereno.
(03/03 18:43:41) TomahnaGuy: In the cavern
(03/03 18:43:46) Nick White: Right Dan'nee
(03/03 18:43:48) TomahnaGuy: Round aeGura
(03/03 18:44:04) Nick White: Alright, that's it guys... I gotta get running.
(03/03 18:44:10) Nick White: Tell Heaven hi if you see her.
(03/03 18:44:13) steve van cleef: I know, but ideally doesnt sound like an emphatic 'dont go there'
(03/03 18:44:15) Dan'nee: Thanks for chatting Nick.
(03/03 18:44:16) TomahnaGuy: Are the DRC worried about this Dereno outbreak?
(03/03 18:44:17) Whilyam: Shorah. Hope to see Sharper.
