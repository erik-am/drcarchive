(03/21 22:13:06) splash1: hellonick
(03/21 22:13:08) Haruko: oh, they cause crime, are poor, and generally nasty
(03/21 22:13:08) Kiyoshi: dont ask :)
(03/21 22:13:08) Nick White: I"m asking...
(03/21 22:13:08) Myst'Aken: Just us
(03/21 22:13:08) Kiyoshi: Yeesha calling :)
(03/21 22:13:08) Nick White: Jazz will tell me at least right?
(03/21 22:13:08) Nick White: What's the party going on here?
(03/21 22:13:18) Jazz: Yeesha calling and parade, Nick
(03/21 22:13:18) Nick White: Oh man, another one?
(03/21 22:13:18) Myst'Aken: If she doesn't faint
(03/21 22:13:22) splash1: we're waiting for Yeesha
(03/21 22:13:22) Kiyoshi: You remember Yeesha, don't yuou?
(03/21 22:13:23) Jazz blushes
(03/21 22:13:25) Sumatria: lol
(03/21 22:13:27) Andrew Eldred: A quasi-religious (and in that sense creepy) gathering for Yeesha.
(03/21 22:13:34) Jimbo puts an arm around peni
(03/21 22:13:36) Jazz: Quasi- religious?
(03/21 22:13:44) ireenquench: hey guys shorah
(03/21 22:13:48) Jazz must remember not to dance then
(03/21 22:13:48) Andrew Eldred: People kneeling? Yeah. Quasi-religious.
(03/21 22:13:49) Nick White: Everybody loves Yeesha
(03/21 22:13:51) Finrel: para-religious?
(03/21 22:13:57) peni snuggles
(03/21 22:13:59) Jazz realises she has to dance
(03/21 22:14:09) Na'Daehn: Yeesha, Yeesha, ...
(03/21 22:14:09) Melcabral does a dance
(03/21 22:14:10) Kiyoshi: but does Yeesha love us?
(03/21 22:14:16) splash1: Nick
(03/21 22:14:17) Finrel: semi-religious?
(03/21 22:14:19) Sc1234freak does a dance
(03/21 22:14:25) Nick White: Apparently not.
(03/21 22:14:34) Finrel: as long as you love you
(03/21 22:14:34) Kiyoshi: o.O
(03/21 22:14:36) ireenquench: what are you guys up to?
(03/21 22:14:37) Jazz: Awwww
(03/21 22:14:45) <sniffle> Haruko is sad

(03/21 22:14:52) Erik: Shorah
(03/21 22:14:59) Kiyoshi: We just summoned Nick ;)
(03/21 22:15:01) Nick White: More colored hair?
(03/21 22:15:02) Jazz: Hoping Yeesha will come again
(03/21 22:15:06) Jazz: But we got Nick instead
(03/21 22:15:10) Jazz cheers
(03/21 22:15:13) Thend: Hello all
(03/21 22:15:14) Sumatria: that works for me
(03/21 22:15:17) Jazz: Copy-cats, Nick
(03/21 22:15:18) ireenquench: hi Nick
(03/21 22:15:19) Jazz starts to laugh
(03/21 22:15:19) Haruko: I wanted pink, but the dye seemed to be missing
(03/21 22:15:22) Andrew Eldred shrugs
(03/21 22:15:23) Erik: hi Thend
(03/21 22:15:33) Kiyoshi: Youre just jealous, Nick ;)
[Nick stands on centre of fountain for a bit
(03/21 22:15:39) Nick White: Here I am.
(03/21 22:15:39) Jazz: It's Yeesha on the fountain!
(03/21 22:15:41) rong: shorah techie folks
(03/21 22:15:43) Andrew Eldred: Life is like a Yeesha summoning. Sometimes, you get Nick.
(03/21 22:15:43) Nick White: I've arrived.
(03/21 22:15:43) Jazz: Oh no
(03/21 22:15:48) meadow: Shorah Nick!! So glad to see u again!!
(03/21 22:15:48) Nick White: What is it that you call me for?
(03/21 22:15:54) Jazz starts to laugh
(03/21 22:15:54) ireenquench roars with laughter
(03/21 22:15:56) Andrew Eldred sarcastically bows.
(03/21 22:15:58) Melcabral starts to laugh
(03/21 22:15:59) Sumatria: lol
(03/21 22:16:10) Jimbo: Hi Nick, I thought u would have been fed to the urwin by now
(03/21 22:16:10) Nick White tries to be funny
(03/21 22:16:15) rong: hey nick, like your dress sense
(03/21 22:16:15) Jazz is amazed!
(03/21 22:16:21) Andrew Eldred: Yeah, speaking of expeditions...
(03/21 22:16:22) ireenquench: Nick, dont you think there's more to this cavern than just jokes and girls?
(03/21 22:16:35) Nick White: Um...
(03/21 22:16:51) rong: you want more than that?
(03/21 22:16:51) Finrel: girls are great, what's wrong with that?
(03/21 22:17:05) Jazz: Err . . splash?
(03/21 22:17:06) Melcabral: splash you're blockin the view, man!
(03/21 22:17:18) trock: fight
(03/21 22:17:18) Jazz pokes splash
(03/21 22:17:19) trock: fight
(03/21 22:17:22) meadow: hey Nick, the Ducks are going down!!!
(03/21 22:17:26) Nick White: You wish!
(03/21 22:17:34) Nick White: Ducks are going Final Four baby!
(03/21 22:17:36) trock: fight
(03/21 22:17:40) Andrew Eldred: Haha. Right.
(03/21 22:17:41) Jazz starts to laugh
(03/21 22:17:43) Nick White cheers
(03/21 22:17:45) meadow: go Gators!!
(03/21 22:17:52) ireenquench: Oh, it's fine, I just think there's more to explore and to question... and the Yeesha stuff is definitely interesting.
(03/21 22:17:55) Nick White is a bit upset...
(03/21 22:17:55) trock: coltss
(03/21 22:18:01) Sumatria: Is that good for the ducks?
(03/21 22:18:03) Andrew Eldred: Ugh, not the gators (I'm from FSU).
(03/21 22:18:26) Nick White: I see the girls with colored hair fad is starting to spread.
(03/21 22:18:33) <sniffle> Jazz is sad
(03/21 22:18:41) Haruko: like I said, we need more colors available :)
(03/21 22:18:48) Nick White: Jazz you were always the first.
(03/21 22:18:49) Sumatria: I like my natural blonde thank you
(03/21 22:18:50) Kiyoshi: maybe its a disease
(03/21 22:18:55) Haruko: I don't really want this color, but it's the closest match
(03/21 22:19:05) meadow: i almost wore my gators jersey today!
(03/21 22:19:07) Jazz thanks you very much!
(03/21 22:19:22) Nick White: Glad you didn't bring that filth in here.
(03/21 22:19:25) ireenquench coughs real hard
(03/21 22:19:28) Jazz: There does seem to be a trend now
(03/21 22:19:30) Andrew Eldred: Agreed.
(03/21 22:19:44) <sniffle> Jazz is sad
(03/21 22:19:57) Kiyoshi: So, Nick, any news on the expedition?
(03/21 22:20:03) Nick White: Could happen tonight.
(03/21 22:20:04) Sc1234freak: When is your trip Nick?
(03/21 22:20:06) meadow: nick, LaFitte says hi! and go gators!
(03/21 22:20:07) Nick White: Depends on Rils.
(03/21 22:20:09) Jazz: Tonight?
(03/21 22:20:12) Jazz cheers
(03/21 22:20:18) Melcabral: that would be awesome
(03/21 22:20:28) Annick: hello all
(03/21 22:20:32) ireenquench: So far just gun practice, but no decision on shooting anythign yet, right?
(03/21 22:20:42) Melcabral: dude, splash, back up!
(03/21 22:20:42) Jazz worries about Nick
(03/21 22:20:42) Nick White: Splash no need to stand right next to me.
(03/21 22:20:47) Sumatria: When you do go I wish you all safe trip
(03/21 22:21:00) Nick White: Thanks.
(03/21 22:21:01) rong: you technologists every actually build anything round here?
(03/21 22:21:02) Myst'Aken wonders how Yeesha got in Nick's wardrobe
(03/21 22:21:02) Jazz: You will be careful, won't you Nick?
(03/21 22:21:04) Johan: nick, do you know when the heek is functional again?
(03/21 22:21:08) Sc1234freak: Can I come too, lol.
(03/21 22:21:15) Nick White: I'll try Jazz but it will be dangerous of course. Very.
(03/21 22:21:18) Nick White laughs
(03/21 22:21:18) Haruko: Guns, what types?
(03/21 22:21:26) Nick White: Big ones.
(03/21 22:21:30) Sc1234freak: Lol
(03/21 22:21:34) Melcabral: ha
(03/21 22:21:39) Haruko: Nice, I like em like that
(03/21 22:21:48) Thend: Hello Nick. Gonna stop by the Spoken Word Night Sharper Roast tonight (UO Hood, 7PM EDT)?
(03/21 22:22:02) Nick White: Hey Thend, probably not. We might be in Negilahn.
(03/21 22:22:14) Thend: Sharper was invited, dunno if he's busy or not
(03/21 22:22:23) Nick White: like I said, we might be in Neg.
(03/21 22:22:26) Jazz: Any idea what time?
(03/21 22:22:34) Thend: Too bad, should be a lot of fun :)
(03/21 22:22:37) Nick White: I'm hoping for something around 6:30.
(03/21 22:22:45) Sc1234freak: What time zone
(03/21 22:22:47) Nick White: Depends on when Rils shows up.
(03/21 22:22:49) Nick White: Here.
(03/21 22:22:51) Thend nods his head
(03/21 22:22:52) Myst'Aken: How can you have a Roast without the Roastee ??
(03/21 22:23:04) Jazz: I am worried for you
(03/21 22:23:11) ireenquench: please take KI pics there Nick and share... it'd be interesting to get a peek at that predator, should you see it.
(03/21 22:23:18) Nick White: We'll see.
(03/21 22:23:21) Sc1234freak: Me to
(03/21 22:23:24) Nick White: DRC forbids most of that stuff.
(03/21 22:23:30) Nick White: Thanks Jazz.
(03/21 22:23:31) Annick: hello Nick could we have a Delin book in our Eden Gira neighborhood ?
(03/21 22:23:33) Sc1234freak: Too bad
(03/21 22:23:36) Sumatria: Jazz, they will be fine
(03/21 22:23:37) Nick White: I apprecate that.
(03/21 22:23:47) Jazz: Will you let me know?
(03/21 22:23:50) Kiyoshi: How will we believe you if we don't see pictures? ;)
(03/21 22:23:52) Jazz: Let us know, I mean
(03/21 22:23:54) Haruko: These weapons are licensed, right?
(03/21 22:23:55) ireenquench: Why are they worried about pictures of animals spread? Or shrubbery?
(03/21 22:23:58) Sc1234freak: Screw that
(03/21 22:24:05) Nick White: You don't have to believe me.
(03/21 22:24:07) Sc1234freak: Use bellots
(03/21 22:24:10) Sc1234freak: Oops
(03/21 22:24:16) Nick White: Jazz will.
(03/21 22:24:19) Jazz nods her head
(03/21 22:24:23) Andrew Eldred: White--don't you think studing the D'ni as they want us to (through their museum exhibits) is biased at best?
(03/21 22:24:36) Nick White: Probably.
(03/21 22:24:42) Kiyoshi chooses not to comment ;)
(03/21 22:25:03) splash1 thanks you
(03/21 22:25:04) darkstar: Dont sound very scientific this expeditiuon if you or rather DRC arn't prepared to share the data
(03/21 22:25:11) Andrew Eldred: Know much about standpoint epistemology? Because we're letting an ancient race dictate our explorations.
(03/21 22:25:24) Finrel gotta get another kilt lifter
(03/21 22:25:34) Jazz starts to laugh
(03/21 22:25:48) ireenquench: Yeah, especially if they start training to shoot an animal they have never seen and dont even know if its responsible for the population drop.
(03/21 22:25:53) Jazz: You should go to one of Doc's discussion groups Andrew
(03/21 22:26:13) Thend: Release of scientific notes would be cool, and logical. What use is scientific study without seeing the results of it?
(03/21 22:26:23) rong: and i need a dictionary
(03/21 22:26:23) darkstar: Well thats not entirely accurate we are letting the self apponted keepers of asn ancient races secrets dictate our explorations
(03/21 22:26:28) Nick White: You'll probably see results. Just not photos.
(03/21 22:26:38) Thend: Wild
(03/21 22:26:40) Andrew Eldred: -That's- not a bad idea, Jazz.
(03/21 22:26:41) Sc1234freak: Too bad
(03/21 22:26:43) Jazz cheers
(03/21 22:27:01) Sc1234freak: What is a featherr, Nick?
(03/21 22:27:06) Finrel: well nick, could you at least tell us, will this little safari at least merit new updates to download?
(03/21 22:27:07) Sc1234freak: Feather*
(03/21 22:27:10) Thend: It's not the way most of us explorers would behave, we like to share whenever possible
(03/21 22:27:13) Thend shrugs
(03/21 22:27:21) Nick White: What is a feather?
(03/21 22:27:27) Nick White: What kind of question is that?
(03/21 22:27:33) Jazz: lol
(03/21 22:27:34) darkstar: I would be interested in at least seeing a scientific description of the beast it taxisomy
(03/21 22:27:34) Andrew Eldred: The deepest question asked of you yet, Nick.
(03/21 22:27:51) Sc1234freak: You go around and type /get feathe
(03/21 22:27:52) ireenquench: Results. Interesting. Doesnt sound like science. More like fixing it. I bet Cate loves the idea of fixing problems.
(03/21 22:28:00) Haruko: Nick, has the DRC been keeping you busy with work?
(03/21 22:28:06) Nick White: Yes, they have.
(03/21 22:28:16) Annick: hello Nick, Please, could we have a Delin book in our Eden Gira's bevin ?
(03/21 22:28:21) Haruko: Working on anything interesting you can tell us about?
(03/21 22:28:22) Nick White: Spending quite a bit of time in Minkata.
(03/21 22:28:23) rong: what perks do you get with the drc?
(03/21 22:28:25) darkstar: Well i think that was she does shes a professional fixer
(03/21 22:28:30) Jazz: Minkata?
(03/21 22:28:44) Haruko: Minkata- is that a newly discovered Age?
(03/21 22:28:44) Andrew Eldred: The name of the previously "unnamed" age.
(03/21 22:28:51) Hu K'hanDhat: Ah, the mysterious new age
(03/21 22:28:51) darkstar: Where did you find the name?
(03/21 22:28:51) ireenquench: Did you find out the name of the desert age?

(03/21 22:28:53) PoJo (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(03/21 22:28:58) Jazz: Is that it's name?
(03/21 22:29:11) Nick White: We found it in some Guild references. Could or could not be the name but we're going with it.
(03/21 22:29:14) Sc1234freak: Bye ya'll
(03/21 22:29:21) Nick White: See ya.
(03/21 22:29:23) Jazz: Sounds fantastic
(03/21 22:29:25) Hu K'hanDhat: Cu
(03/21 22:29:27) Sumatria: bye Sc
(03/21 22:29:27) ireenquench: Any idea what it means in D'ni?
(03/21 22:29:28) Jazz: Bye Sc
(03/21 22:29:28) Haruko: Have you taken a trip to visit it?
(03/21 22:29:36) Nick White: It means heavily scarred.
(03/21 22:29:46) Jazz: Oohhh
(03/21 22:29:47) ireenquench: Cool.
(03/21 22:29:48) darkstar: Better move its place in the list last time i checked it was still in the T's lol
(03/21 22:29:55) Jazz: Scarred by what?
(03/21 22:30:00) Andrew Eldred: Or who?
(03/21 22:30:12) Sumatria: how?
(03/21 22:30:25) Kiyoshi: like a broken heart?
(03/21 22:30:35) Nick White: I suppose you'll all find out.
(03/21 22:30:47) strega3: lol
(03/21 22:30:52) darkstar: Or is it in the physical sense
(03/21 22:31:21) darkstar: Presumably whatever the D'Ni did with it
(03/21 22:31:28) Finrel got my kilt lifter, now everyone is rapidly becoming more interesting
(03/21 22:31:29) Thend: Nick, just curious, could you tell us something about your education? I mean, seemed you were primarily translator, then you are co-hunter, now you are Age inspector
(03/21 22:31:45) Andrew Eldred heard Nick was bait, not co-hunter.
(03/21 22:31:54) Finrel: lol
(03/21 22:31:56) Jazz cringes
(03/21 22:31:58) Nick White: Exactly Anderew.
(03/21 22:32:02) Andrew Eldred: Yeah Jazz, you know it.
(03/21 22:32:02) Finrel cringes
(03/21 22:32:04) Nick White: I'm not going because of my education.
(03/21 22:32:09) Jazz: lol
(03/21 22:32:12) darkstar: Obviously with the staffing limitations the DRC are big on multi=tasking
(03/21 22:32:13) rong: its the lack of it
(03/21 22:32:16) Nick White: Of course, I'm just fast.
(03/21 22:32:16) Haruko: Bait, eh? You should be paid extra for that
(03/21 22:32:25) Andrew Eldred: That true? Care to prove it, Nick?
(03/21 22:32:54) Hu K'hanDhat: So you are not bait because you taste quite well :))
(03/21 22:32:56) Thend: Movin' up the ol' corporate ladder
(03/21 22:33:05) ireenquench: Sorry for interrupting...Nick, did you find out more about the supposed "training" purposes of the Age? Minkata?
(03/21 22:33:14) Nick White: And I'm friends with Sharper... I guess.
(03/21 22:33:19) darkstar: When did the DRC incorporate?
(03/21 22:33:20) Nick White: Yep. Moving up. Wahoo!
(03/21 22:33:34) Thend: Ask Lexie, darkstar lol
(03/21 22:33:35) Nick White: Yes. We have Ireen.
(03/21 22:33:49) darkstar: lol
(03/21 22:33:50) ireenquench: Great, care to share that info?
(03/21 22:33:59) Haruko nods her head
(03/21 22:34:00) Nick White: What's life without some mystery?
(03/21 22:34:04) Hu K'hanDhat: And Sharper is fond of you .. in his own typical way ...
(03/21 22:34:05) ireenquench laughs
(03/21 22:34:06) Andrew Eldred: Agreed.
(03/21 22:34:10) rong: frustrating
(03/21 22:34:10) Thend: Not so frustrating...
(03/21 22:34:18) rong: lol
(03/21 22:34:27) Andrew Eldred: Hey Nick, not that any of us do, but I know -some- people sneak looks into Sharper's journal. Do you?
(03/21 22:34:30) darkstar: Well gives us something to look forward too lol
(03/21 22:34:36) Nick White: A particular Guild used the Age.
(03/21 22:34:41) Nick White: I'll leave it at that.
(03/21 22:34:47) Nick White: Bring it on Jimbo.
(03/21 22:34:51) Nick White is a bit upset...
(03/21 22:34:59) Nick White laughs
(03/21 22:35:21) Jazz is wondering which Guild now
(03/21 22:35:25) Kiyoshi wonders if the DRC are all they appear to be
(03/21 22:35:33) Nick White: Lots of wondering.
(03/21 22:35:35) Haruko: Maintainers maybe?
(03/21 22:35:38) Nick White: That's good.
(03/21 22:35:38) Andrew Eldred wonders, too. Wonders something.
(03/21 22:35:40) rong: guild of observers i should imagine
(03/21 22:35:56) Nick White: I know a girl named Wonder.
(03/21 22:36:08) Kiyoshi: Wonder Woman??
(03/21 22:36:11) Andrew Eldred: Surprise Surprise, Nick knows a girl by any name.
(03/21 22:36:15) Andrew Eldred: Jazz, your thoughts?

(03/21 22:36:30) Finrel: don't be hatin'
(03/21 22:36:43) Andrew Eldred: The red cheeks don't go well with the violet hair.
(03/21 22:36:55) ireenquench: Seems like Sharper is a bit worried about you, Nick. And I am abit worried myself. You know, all this flirting.
(03/21 22:36:55) Kiyoshi shakes his head
(03/21 22:36:56) Jazz is beginning to wonder if Andrew is a true friend
(03/21 22:36:56) Nick White: Everything goes well with the violet hair.

(03/21 22:38:37) Nick White: Have me met?
(03/21 22:38:39) Krepta: I really wish I was a programmer and could help Cyan with programming stuff. I'd work for Free if I was allowed to.
(03/21 22:38:51) Bukwheet: Umm, I'm Canadian...
(03/21 22:38:57) Nick White: Nice.
(03/21 22:38:59) Hu K'hanDhat: Mr. White .. one question .. any chance someone takes over the translation job ... we are still missing some books in the haal of kings
(03/21 22:39:05) Bukwheet: No, I don't think so
(03/21 22:39:20) Krepta: Yes, More King Books, Woot!
(03/21 22:39:21) Nick White: Those books are all done. Not sure why they aren't all in there. I'll look into that.
(03/21 22:39:31) MeKtonUru: Come here, you will see yourself
(03/21 22:39:34) Nick White: Not good to be Canadian?
(03/21 22:39:36) Kiyoshi: That would be appreciated

(03/21 22:40:08) Nick White: Of course.
(03/21 22:40:25) Haruko: I've heard rumors about Bahro sightings in the neighborhoods. Is the DRC concerned?
(03/21 22:40:25) Hu K'hanDhat: Yes, but that was years ago Ireenquench .. somebody must have taken them
(03/21 22:40:27) Finrel: this hood is fillin' up!

(03/21 22:41:24) Johan: but there was no sign of an bahro
(03/21 22:41:25) ireenquench: I heard those rumors as well. Talked to an explorer who saw a Bahro in a DRC hood, I believe him.

(03/21 22:42:35) Krepta: Hey, Nick, can Cyan sell Yeesha Shirts and D'ni Gorahyans?
(03/21 22:42:36) Nick White: I've got a good stack of it Thend. Maybe I should just hand it all over to you and you can go over it in your meetings.
(03/21 22:42:49) Andrew Eldred: Haha, well then maybe Zandi would--you may've scared Yeesha away.
(03/21 22:43:01) Jazz: Wow Thend!
