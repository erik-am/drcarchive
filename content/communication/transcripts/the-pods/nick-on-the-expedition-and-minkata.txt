(03/22 19:34:49) Nick White: Depends what Sharper tells her.
(03/22 19:35:01) Nick White: And how she reacts to it.
(03/22 19:35:11) Vivicus: shorah
(03/22 19:35:33) AKA.: We can hope it will be something good so it will stay open
(03/22 19:35:44) Nick White: Yeah, I think it should stay open.
(03/22 19:35:50) Nick White: IF Sharper is smart.
(03/22 19:35:54) 909: Any plans for another expedition? or too soon to tell?
(03/22 19:35:54) Nick White: Which he is....
(03/22 19:35:58) Erik: I think he is
(03/22 19:36:07) Nick White: I think we're waiting to see what Cate says...

(03/22 19:37:04) Annacat: Heya all :-)
(03/22 19:37:09) AKA.: Didn't he have the dereno book early?
(03/22 19:37:18) Erik: yes that's true
(03/22 19:37:26) KL/RREN: Yep
(03/22 19:37:26) Nick White: Yeah, and he's seen others as well, at least that's the rumor.
(03/22 19:37:33) AKA.: Wondering if he had any more?
(03/22 19:37:37) Ae'thon: Any chance we can get any photos from the Negilahn expedition Nick?
(03/22 19:37:50) Nick White: I'm sure there is a chance.
(03/22 19:37:55) KL/RREN: Yeah, some pics please :)
(03/22 19:37:58) Erik: well, I don't want to see that creature ...
(03/22 19:38:00) Nick White: But the DRC is pretty tight with that stuff.
(03/22 19:38:01) Erik: yikes
(03/22 19:38:09) Ae'thon: I can imagine...
(03/22 19:38:10) Nick White: What was left of it...
(03/22 19:38:15) Erik: exactly...
(03/22 19:38:16) 909: ungh....
(03/22 19:38:19) Vivicus shivers
(03/22 19:38:35) Johan: for sharper it was a nightmare?
(03/22 19:38:40) Ae'thon: It was pretty bad eh?
(03/22 19:38:45) Nick White: Nightmare?
(03/22 19:38:49) Annacat: What kind of mad crazy fun is being had in D'ni today? ;-)
(03/22 19:38:54) Johan: yes he says that
(03/22 19:39:00) Nick White: He was a little spooked that's for sure.
(03/22 19:39:27) 909: Guess you'll be on toher projects while we wait to see what traspires of this expedition?
(03/22 19:39:35) Ae'thon: Maybe he wasn't prepared for what you guys saw
(03/22 19:39:45) Nick White: Don't think any of us were.
(03/22 19:39:52) Nick White: I'll be in Minkata later.
(03/22 19:40:01) Nick White: Yeah, working on other stuff until we know what's going on with Neg next.

(03/22 19:40:15) 909: *change*
(03/22 19:40:18) Erik: Where did you find the name of it? Any interesting documents about the Age?
(03/22 19:40:20) AKA.: What is Minkata like Nick>
(03/22 19:40:45) Nick White: Guild stuff mostly... references to a training Age of sorts... we think that's it.
(03/22 19:40:50) Nick White: Seems to fit but no way to know for sure.
(03/22 19:40:54) 909: Heard some speculation it could be some sort of weapons range....
(03/22 19:40:56) Nick White: It's not stamped on the Book.
(03/22 19:41:14) Erik: a bit like Gahreesen, but for another Guild?
(03/22 19:41:32) Ae'thon: A training age?
(03/22 19:41:32) Nick White: Training wise, not visually.
(03/22 19:41:42) 909: do you know which Giuld it was for?
(03/22 19:41:47) Erik: interesting
(03/22 19:42:04) Mari.: Hello everyone

(03/22 19:48:12) Ae'thon: You were very brave to step out of the pod in the first place
(03/22 19:48:21) Nick White: Well... I do what I can.
(03/22 19:48:32) gelf56: are we safe going there?

(03/22 19:49:21) Erik: Nick, when I go to Negilahn, I always see a pair of red, blinking eyes in the bushes... Do you knows what it is?
(03/22 19:49:24) gelf56: ok good so what ever it is out there keeps away from us
(03/22 19:49:33) Nick White: I don't know what the red eyes are.
(03/22 19:49:49) Nick White: It does seem to keep away from us if we're in the pod.
(03/22 19:49:49) Ae'thon: Did you get a chance to get a closer look?
(03/22 19:49:57) Nick White: Closer lok at?
(03/22 19:50:06) Ae'thon: the eyes
(03/22 19:50:09) Nick White: No.
