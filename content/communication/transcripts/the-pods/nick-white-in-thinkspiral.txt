(03/27 20:04:20) Pixel: Too much time with sharper
(03/27 20:04:24) Desert Eagle: what about that Yahvo text?
(03/27 20:04:27) Nick White: Doing other stuff.
(03/27 20:04:34) TiareSim: Like what?
(03/27 20:04:39) Nick White: Minkata.
(03/27 20:04:40) Pixel: When's the next expedition then?

(03/27 20:05:07) TiareSim: I heard he ran off for a bit
(03/27 20:05:09) Nick White: Not sure.
(03/27 20:05:38) TiareSim: Well, could you tell him we're concerned about him, when you see him?
(03/27 20:05:44) Pixel: And cate? how is she dealing with what you found in negilahn?
(03/27 20:05:45) Nick White: I will.
(03/27 20:05:54) Nick White: I guess well. Sharper didn't tell me much.
(03/27 20:05:59) Desert Eagle: hey... any idea when Payiferen is going to be released? will it follow the trend of new pod age every two weeks?
(03/27 20:06:10) Nick White: Probably.
(03/27 20:06:28) Nick White: My guess would be next week.
(03/27 20:06:34) Pixel: Shorah mister cloak smile.gif
(03/27 20:06:35) Desert Eagle: so... I'm guessing that is the desert pod, right?

(03/27 20:08:58) TiareSim: Where did you find it?
(03/27 20:08:59) Sienna: You wrote it? Presumptuous, don't you think?
(03/27 20:09:00) Nick White: I guess that's official.

(03/27 20:09:06) Mister Cloak: We appreciate it
(03/27 20:09:06) Nick White: I translated it.

(03/27 20:09:12) Nick White: Big difference.
(03/27 20:09:13) Desert Eagle: ok, thanks! there are people who think it's fanfic, so I wanted to clear up the confusion

(03/27 20:09:39) Sienna: Hmm. Would you mind if I spread the rumor that you claim to have written it?
(03/27 20:09:48) Desert Eagle: did the D'ni actually have some kind of Bible?
(03/27 20:09:50) TiareSim: Is there a second piece to it?
(03/27 20:09:54) Nick White: Yeah they did.
(03/27 20:10:08) Nick White: There's quite a bit of stuff on religion we've got.
