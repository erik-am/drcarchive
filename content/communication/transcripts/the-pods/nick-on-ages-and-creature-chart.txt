(03/07 19:43:21) Vivicus: Shorah everyone!
(03/07 19:43:24) Erik: New City locations? That's good news...
(03/07 19:43:34) Erik: could you tell us something about those?
(03/07 19:43:40) Vivicus: Hi nick!
(03/07 19:43:49) Nick White: The Watcher's Pub is probably next.
(03/07 19:43:50) Nick White: It's on the website list.
(03/07 19:44:05) Erik: Cool.
(03/07 19:44:15) Jimbo: U always say that. What if it isnt the DRC that make the thingss work?
(03/07 19:44:33) Nick White: The DRC doesn't make some things work...I"ll give you that.
(03/07 19:44:38) Nick White: But we do make other things work...
(03/07 19:44:45) Jimbo: there u go
(03/07 19:44:46) Nick White: So not sure what you want me to say?
(03/07 19:45:00) Nick White: I'm just telling you about what we're making work...
(03/07 19:45:08) Jimbo: i dont want u to say anything
(03/07 19:45:25) Erik: On a sidenote, do you know if Sharper will show up soon?
(03/07 19:45:30) Jimbo: things work perpectly fine it seems
(03/07 19:45:52) Nick White: Sharper should be back down in the cavern tomorrow.
(03/07 19:45:53) Jimbo: im just waiting for my peni
(03/07 19:45:58) Nick White: He's been up on the surface.
(03/07 19:46:07) Nick White: And is making a supply trip down.
(03/07 19:46:11) Nick White: Probably as we speak.
(03/07 19:46:17) Erik: Okay!
(03/07 19:46:31) Jimbo: has anybody seen that dude sharperyet?
(03/07 19:46:46) Nick White: I have.
(03/07 19:46:54) Jimbo: where?
(03/07 19:46:59) Nick White: Teledahn.
(03/07 19:47:01) Nick White: City.
(03/07 19:47:05) Rannvig waves hello
(03/07 19:47:08) Jimbo: hm
(03/07 19:47:10) Nick White: A few places.
(03/07 19:47:38) Jimbo: and how is he? is he allright?
(03/07 19:47:49) Nick White: Yeah, seems good.
(03/07 19:47:56) Erik: I also noticed Negilahn's creature chart is gone. Why? It was interesting, although there aren't many creatures to see at the moment. But still...
(03/07 19:48:06) Nick White: Really?
(03/07 19:48:22) KL/RREN: Yep
(03/07 19:48:24) Top Gun: I guess they didn't want people to be disappointed at not being able to see the stuff on there
(03/07 19:48:42) Nick White: yeah, that's weird.
(03/07 19:48:50) Nick White: who keeps stealing the chart?
(03/07 19:48:52) Rivenorth: confirmed chart gone
(03/07 19:48:57) Erik: So, did someone else take it?
(03/07 19:48:57) KL/RREN starts to laugh
(03/07 19:49:03) Erik: the bahro?
(03/07 19:49:05) Rannvig: not much for museum exhibits
(03/07 19:49:23) Nick White: I guess someone wants to hang it in their bedroom.
(03/07 19:49:29) Erik starts to laugh
(03/07 19:49:47) Rannvig: not really a place for a school trip, huh?
(03/07 19:50:01) Nick White: In it's day I'm sure it was....
(03/07 19:50:14) Nick White: Pretty sweet school trip...travel to another Age and you don't need a school bus.
(03/07 19:51:01) Erik: Are the creatues in the other Museum Ages alright? no predator issues there?
(03/07 19:51:22) Nick White: Populations have fallen in just about all the Museum Books.
(03/07 19:51:46) Erik: Hmm, that's odd...
(03/07 19:51:48) Syn: where did the paper with creatures on it go?
(03/07 19:51:55) Nick White: Not sure.
(03/07 19:52:03) KL/RREN: sharper :)
(03/07 19:52:21) Syn: what happened in update?
(03/07 19:52:36) ngc2392: un quebecois ?
(03/07 19:53:13) gypsyrdrnnr: What are you checking on today, Nick?
(03/07 19:53:18) Erik: Nick, do you know what triggered the rotation of Delin's statue?
(03/07 19:53:24) Nick White: Museum doors for one....
(03/07 19:53:30) Nick White: Finally...
(03/07 19:53:41) Nick White: then I'll probably be off to the new Age we've recently discovered...
(03/07 19:53:54) Nick White: Early one but it may get the fastrack treatment.
(03/07 19:53:54) Erik: the nameless Age on the drc website?
(03/07 19:54:01) Nick White: Yeah, no name yet.
(03/07 19:54:04) Nick White: Can't find one.
(03/07 19:54:14) Erik: you're all making us curious :-)
(03/07 19:54:15) Top Gun: That sounds...very tantalizing
(03/07 19:54:28) Nick White: Pretty weird place.
(03/07 19:54:29) gypsyrdrnnr: Is it unusual for the d'ni not to name an age?
(03/07 19:54:31) KL/RREN: call it 68,5
(03/07 19:54:37) Erik: weird? in what way?
(03/07 19:54:42) Nick White: I'm sure they named it, we just haven't been able to find out what.
(03/07 19:54:49) Nick White: We'll name it ourselves if we can't....
(03/07 19:54:52) Top Gun: You could always lobby for Nick's Age
(03/07 19:54:57) Nick White: Ha!
(03/07 19:54:58) gypsyrdrnnr: :)
(03/07 19:55:00) Erik starts to laugh
(03/07 19:55:01) Nick White: Not this place.
(03/07 19:55:01) Syn: whens the next portal in the new age?
(03/07 19:55:15) Rivenorth: recently .. takes some time still then to secure it i guess?
(03/07 19:55:23) MessengerOfJakooth: Where is Nick?
(03/07 19:55:36) To MessengerOfJakooth: museum
(03/07 19:55:39) Nick White: Yeah it's at least a couple of months away probably.
(03/07 19:56:03) Nick White: But given Er'Cana's recent delays that's a good thing.
(03/07 19:56:29) Top Gun: Did anything in particular happen with Er'Cana?
(03/07 19:56:37) Opsus waves hello
(03/07 19:56:37) Top Gun: Or just the usual complications?
(03/07 19:56:43) Erik: something with oven tests if i'm right
(03/07 19:56:44) Syn (I'm on the surface, be back in a minute):
(03/07 19:56:54) Top Gun: Ah, that's right
(03/07 19:57:03) Jimbo: aww, u overheard
(03/07 19:57:18) gypsyrdrnnr: i'm sure somebody's already asked this, but how did Sharper's meeting go?
(03/07 19:57:19) Nick White: Yeah, the ovens are having problems as well as the silo and the whole pellet registration system.
(03/07 19:57:25) Nick White: Laxman stuff... mostly.
(03/07 19:57:30) Nick White: Pretty well...
(03/07 19:57:35) Nick White: Everyone seems happy.
(03/07 19:57:58) gypsyrdrnnr: that's good
(03/07 19:58:07) Erik: That's a good thing to hear! :)
(03/07 19:58:08) Top Gun: Did he find out about that vigil in his honor?
(03/07 19:58:25) Top Gun: I'm curious if he was flattered, or just weirded-out :P
(03/07 19:58:46) Nick White: He laughed.
(03/07 19:58:52) Nick White: But a happy "that's nice" laugh
(03/07 19:59:24) Erik smiles
(03/07 19:59:59) Opsus: Did someone take the animal chart from the desk over there?
(03/07 20:00:33) MessengerOfJakooth: Any more news on Sharper?
(03/07 20:00:51) Kelm: Hey Whats going on?
(03/07 20:00:55) Nick White: He's taking supply trip down...
(03/07 20:00:59) Nick White: Should be here son.
(03/07 20:01:03) Nick White: soon.
(03/07 20:01:35) Kelm: Hello Nick
(03/07 20:01:37) Nick White: I'm gonna go grab a creature chart...one sec.
[Note: Nick tries to get a chart]
(03/07 20:05:52) Erik: hi Nick, found one?
(03/07 20:05:53) Opsus: good idea
(03/07 20:05:55) Nick White: That was a waste of time.
(03/07 20:05:57) TLink: thats the way the D'ni did it
(03/07 20:05:58) KL/RREN: Wb
(03/07 20:06:04) gypsyrdrnnr: wb, nick

(03/07 20:06:29) Rivenorth: good to have copy's around
(03/07 20:06:57) Nick White: Well I suppose I better get back to working on something...
(03/07 20:07:07) gypsyrdrnnr: so, what's it like to be a superstar and have a crowd around you all the time?
(03/07 20:07:13) Nick White: And I hear Cate might be walking around I don't want to be here when she comes.
(03/07 20:07:17) Nick White: So, later guys...
