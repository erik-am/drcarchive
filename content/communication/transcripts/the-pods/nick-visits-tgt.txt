(03/09 23:47:32) Mystlander: You said someone had a strange encounter with one of the animals, or did I misunderstand?
(03/09 23:47:49) DocOlanA: Shorah everyone.
(03/09 23:47:56) Nick White: I think you may have.
(03/09 23:48:02) Zukeenee: Shorah... people.
(03/09 23:48:09) Mystlander says DOH!
(03/09 23:48:15) Warren Weisstieg: good evening everyone
(03/09 23:48:17) SheilaR: shorah
(03/09 23:48:23) Brayden: Greetings. =)
(03/09 23:48:30) cxevalo: Shorah
(03/09 23:48:31) Mystlander: !Shorah everyone! And welcome to The Great Tree!
(03/09 23:48:32) Nick White: Hey guys. Was anyone here when I was here yesterday?
(03/09 23:48:37) tacitus59: Hello
(03/09 23:48:45) cxevalo: yes
(03/09 23:48:48) SheilaR: yes
(03/09 23:48:49) Warren Weisstieg: Not me
(03/09 23:48:50) DocOlanA: I wasn't. I was at the Sharper Watch. Which failed to bear fruit.
(03/09 23:48:55) Xavius: Top o' the morning to ya'!
(03/09 23:48:56) Brayden: I wasn't here yesterday.
(03/09 23:48:57) Xavius bows
(03/09 23:49:00) DocOlanA: Someone relayed your message that he wasn't coming, though.
(03/09 23:49:16) Mystlander: Speaking of Sharper... where is he, Nick?!
(03/09 23:49:32) Xavius: But the question on everyone's minds..
(03/09 23:49:41) Xavius: Is there any plans for an Eddie Relto page?
(03/09 23:49:41) Nick White: Not sure.
(03/09 23:49:43) Xavius: o.0
(03/09 23:49:47) Warren Weisstieg: Be patient, Nick has said that he is busy
(03/09 23:49:51) Nick White: Where he is at the moment.
(03/09 23:49:55) Xavius: :P
(03/09 23:49:55) Zukeenee: I'd love an Eddie in my Relto!
(03/09 23:50:06) Xavius: Just saying.
(03/09 23:50:10) Xavius whistles innocently.
(03/09 23:50:17) shrimpy: yea until he falls off ur relto
(03/09 23:50:29) Xavius: Well..
(03/09 23:50:36) Zukeenee: Eddie's magical. He would just fly back up.
(03/09 23:50:42) Xavius: Yeah.
(03/09 23:50:45) DocOlanA: I can guess that Sharper's busy. But we did all wait around all day yesterday, and today for him. It'd be nice if he could stop by for five minutes and say hi.
(03/09 23:50:46) Nick White: Huh?
(03/09 23:50:54) Xavius: Eddie's the beachball.
(03/09 23:50:59) Nick White: Ah...
(03/09 23:51:03) Warren Weisstieg: Nick has left the conversation.........
(03/09 23:51:11) Brayden laughs
(03/09 23:51:21) Nick White: Yeah it would Doc. But last I heard, Sharper does what he wants to do.
(03/09 23:51:28) Xavius: Okay, I uppose we should tlk about the more important aspects of uru.
(03/09 23:51:31) Xavius: Carry on.
(03/09 23:51:31) Brayden: We're nuts... naming beach ball and whatnot
(03/09 23:51:39) Nick White: Nuts or bored.
(03/09 23:51:49) Xavius: I prefer somewhere in between.
(03/09 23:51:51) Zukeenee: Eh... both.
(03/09 23:51:55) Nick White: Right.
(03/09 23:52:03) DocOlanA: That's dangerous for a man who's relied on support of the vox populi, isn't it? At least, from what I've heard of him. I haven't ever met him, which was why I was so keen to.
(03/09 23:52:07) Nick White: Go run around the hood 100 times if you get bored.
(03/09 23:52:16) Nick White: I heard something magical happens if you do.
(03/09 23:52:17) Xavius: :P
(03/09 23:52:23) Brayden laughs
(03/09 23:52:25) Warren Weisstieg: Hehe
(03/09 23:52:25) Xavius shifts eyes.
(03/09 23:52:28) Nick White: I guess Doc.
(03/09 23:52:34) Xavius: Now, if someone was o go after this endeavor..
(03/09 23:52:34) Nick White: I'll leave that to him.
(03/09 23:52:35) Brayden: Now everyone's going to be running laps
(03/09 23:52:43) Xavius: Would it just be the square or the whole of Bevin?
(03/09 23:52:47) Cycreim: Hey guys!
(03/09 23:52:52) Nick White: The entire Bevin.
(03/09 23:52:56) Xavius: Ah.
(03/09 23:52:56) Brayden: Hey Cy.
(03/09 23:52:59) Xavius: I will just..
(03/09 23:53:04) Nick White: It was very specific in the ancient manuscript I read.
(03/09 23:53:07) Cycreim: What's up?
(03/09 23:53:07) Xavius: I'll just go sight-seeing around bevin.
(03/09 23:53:07) shrimpy says DOH!
(03/09 23:53:12) Xavius: 100 times.
(03/09 23:53:14) Nick White: And if it doesn't work the first time, it said you may need to do it again.
(03/09 23:53:22) Nick White: And faster.
(03/09 23:53:26) Cycreim: Hahaha
(03/09 23:53:28) Nick White: At least a full minute faster.
(03/09 23:53:33) Warren Weisstieg: By the way, why is Cate so excited for Douglass to be down here?
(03/09 23:53:39) Nick White: If you don't do it a full minute faster than it won't work.
(03/09 23:53:48) shrimpy is sorta bummed...
(03/09 23:53:49) Nick White: But you have to run both times the whole time.
(03/09 23:53:51) shrimpy: brb
(03/09 23:53:59) DocOlanA: Yeah, how does the rest of the DRC feel about Sharper coming back?
(03/09 23:54:07) Xavius: 1.
(03/09 23:54:12) shrimpy: ill b bac kin a hour
(03/09 23:54:12) Warren Weisstieg: The first annual D'ni marathon
(03/09 23:54:12) Eleri: Sorry, didn't mean to quish people at the link point
(03/09 23:54:14) vid: Hey, Nick... how're you doing?
(03/09 23:54:33) Nick White: I think they feel pretty good.
(03/09 23:54:54) Warren Weisstieg: Seems like a very forgiving group
(03/09 23:54:57) Xavius: 2.
(03/09 23:55:02) Nick White: you stopped?
(03/09 23:55:09) Xavius: Is it continuous or continual?
(03/09 23:55:11) Brayden: No breaks!
(03/09 23:55:29) Nick White: Now you have to start over and anyone who saw you stop has to do it 200 times.
(03/09 23:55:29) DocOlanA: Again, I'm at a bit of a disadvantage. I only know Sharper from what others have told me. Perhaps I've got the wrong impression.
(03/09 23:55:35) Xavius: And remember to shout cause I can't hear you.
(03/09 23:55:42) Warren Weisstieg: Same here
(03/09 23:56:08) Nick White: You may be right... Doc. You'll have to decide.
(03/09 23:56:11) Brayden: I only know him from....well...peeking in his private journals. XD
(03/09 23:56:11) Xavius: 3,
(03/09 23:56:13) cxevalo: when did great tree get a firefly?
(03/09 23:56:19) DocOlanA: I will . . . soon as he actually deigns to let us meet him.
(03/09 23:56:27) Xavius: Firefly?
(03/09 23:56:39) Zukeenee: That firefly has always been there.
(03/09 23:56:46) Zukeenee: Unless you mean a spaceship...
(03/09 23:56:48) cxevalo: oh
(03/09 23:56:49) Xavius: Whoo, superjump!
(03/09 23:56:56) Warren Weisstieg: Well, what's something the DRC is very excited about lately other than Douglass, NIck?
(03/09 23:57:11) Xavius: What's this firefly business?
(03/09 23:57:12) vid: I know everyone likes asking about Doug.... but Nick, is it ok if I ask what YOU'VE been working on? Or if you've got any ladies advice? :)
(03/09 23:57:24) Xavius: What's this firefly business?
(03/09 23:57:24) Nick White: Ladies advince?
(03/09 23:57:28) Nick White: advice?
(03/09 23:57:30) Brayden laughs
(03/09 23:57:31) Nick White: Uh...
(03/09 23:57:40) Nebodin starts to laugh
(03/09 23:57:43) vid: Sure, you're popular with the female explorers and resengs, right? ;)
(03/09 23:57:45) Nick White: I've already causes one lady to leave. I'll not be giving advice.
(03/09 23:58:03) vid: Actually, I think she's been looking for you...
(03/09 23:58:09) Nick White: Really?
(03/09 23:58:09) Warren Weisstieg: Maybe she was deft?
(03/09 23:58:21) Xavius: We officially have lag.
(03/09 23:58:23) vid nods his head
(03/09 23:58:49) Nick White: Good at least she hasn't left the place then.
(03/09 23:59:07) Brayden: Who is this you're speaking of anyway?
(03/09 23:59:07) Nick White: As far as what I've been working on.... the new place.
(03/09 23:59:16) DocOlanA: New place?
(03/09 23:59:22) Zukeenee: The nameless place?
(03/09 23:59:25) Warren Weisstieg: The unknown name one
(03/09 23:59:26) vid: The "nameless" place?
(03/09 23:59:30) Marjan: It's still a nameless age?
(03/09 23:59:35) Nick White: Yes, the nameless place.
(03/09 23:59:38) Brayden: Enigma Age?
(03/09 23:59:43) Nick White: the ----- place.
(03/09 23:59:49) Xavius: Well, three laps in the sqaure equals one Bevin..
(03/10 00:00:02) vid: Is it an inhabited age? Or any notable life?
(03/10 00:00:13) Xavius: Or circle, apparently.
(03/10 00:00:21) DocOlanA: Well, if we don't know it's name, what can you tell us about it?
(03/10 00:00:31) Xavius: Life that comes around more than every 12 hours?
(03/10 00:00:41) Nick White: Not so far.
(03/10 00:00:43) Xavius: No offense.
(03/10 00:00:58) Zukeenee: And what do you mean by it being "big"? Big structures? Big mountains? Vast expanses of land...?
(03/10 00:01:09) Xavius: Big like Kadish?
(03/10 00:01:12) DocOlanA: Actually that's another thing I'd like to know. How the investigation into the depopulation on Negilahn is going.
(03/10 00:01:16) Nick White: Big like vast expanse of land.
(03/10 00:01:17) Xavius: Or big like Gahreesen?
(03/10 00:01:22) Xavius: Kadish.
(03/10 00:01:23) DocOlanA: Huge tracts of land?
(03/10 00:01:23) Zukeenee: Ah, okay.
(03/10 00:01:28) DocOlanA: Sorry, had to.
(03/10 00:01:33) Nick White: It's about to start in full.
(03/10 00:01:35) Xavius: Is it from either of the expansions.
(03/10 00:01:36) Warren Weisstieg: Sounds fun
(03/10 00:01:39) Xavius: Though those have names..
(03/10 00:01:41) Brayden: Cool. I'd itching to explore a big place.
(03/10 00:01:49) Brayden: I've been*
(03/10 00:02:01) Nick White: The expansions?
(03/10 00:02:03) vid: Are there any plans to release some photos or descriptions of this new world?
(03/10 00:02:08) DocOlanA: So, does it have a name that's just not being released, or was the name worn off the linking book, or what?
(03/10 00:02:10) b'lyn: wow busy in here :)
(03/10 00:02:21) Nick White: We just haven't found the name yet.
(03/10 00:02:24) Xavius: OMG, lag.
(03/10 00:02:28) Xavius needs a moment to breathe!
(03/10 00:02:28) Brayden: Interesting.
(03/10 00:02:32) Nick White: sometimes it's on the book, sometimes it's in the Age.
(03/10 00:02:35) Brayden: No breathing!
(03/10 00:02:36) Nick White: Sometimes we make it up.
(03/10 00:02:43) Xavius: -.-
(03/10 00:02:59) Eleri: Have you had tiome for any translation work, Nick?
(03/10 00:03:03) Warren Weisstieg: HaHave you made up a name for any age on the DRC site list or the ones we have currently?
(03/10 00:03:05) Nick White: Not really eleri.
(03/10 00:03:11) Xavius: If I make 100 laps, how about you wokr on an Eddie Relto Page?
(03/10 00:03:13) Zukeenee: Call it... Braykehlahtahbahzahstay!
(03/10 00:03:30) Xavius: Sovokhbahr!
(03/10 00:03:34) Xavius: MWUAHHAHAHA!!
(03/10 00:03:37) Eleri is sad
(03/10 00:03:52) DocOlanA: I say we should call it Bob.
(03/10 00:03:53) Xavius: winded
(03/10 00:03:54) Nick White: Alright, I'm gonna go see Sharper.
(03/10 00:03:56) Xavius needs a moment to breathe!
(03/10 00:04:02) Whilyam: Will he be meeting wit us?
(03/10 00:04:03) Mystlander consoles Eleri
(03/10 00:04:03) Eleri: I'm never calling it Bob
(03/10 00:04:04) Nick White: Maybe I'll come back afterward.
(03/10 00:04:06) Joey Zoonishii: Gosh.
(03/10 00:04:10) vid: Take care of yourself, Nick.
(03/10 00:04:11) Warren Weisstieg: Tell him I said hi
(03/10 00:04:13) DocOlanA: Well no one said YOU had to live on bob.
(03/10 00:04:14) Cycreim: Nice.
(03/10 00:04:15) Marjan: could you ask him to come over?
(03/10 00:04:16) Whilyam: Mr. Secretary? Will we see him!
(03/10 00:04:18) Zukeenee: Let him know we love him, and we want to see him soon!
(03/10 00:04:18) Warren Weisstieg: even though he doesn't know me
(03/10 00:04:22) vid: Ask Sharper if he needs a website done!
(03/10 00:04:24) Xavius: You will be getting a KImail from me when I have 100 laps..
(03/10 00:04:29) Brayden: Hahaha vid
(03/10 00:04:30) vid: aw, too late :P
(03/10 00:04:31) Cycreim: Well that was fun!
(03/10 00:04:32) Warren Weisstieg: have a nice evening Nick
(03/10 00:04:38) Xavius needs a moment to breathe!
(03/10 00:04:43) Joey Zoonishii: I like how I always come in just when one of the DRC members leaves...
[Note: Nick returns after about half an hour.]
(03/10 00:22:01) Nick White: Uh... not a big fan of merging with guys in big green hats.
(03/10 00:22:05) Whilyam: What was this project the DRC was going to work with?
(03/10 00:22:06) Xavius: LOL
(03/10 00:22:09) Brayden laughs
(03/10 00:22:10) Xavius starts to laugh
(03/10 00:22:11) DocOlanA: I don't know who it was, Nick, but I'm rather concerned about the Neg problem myself. If there's anything I can do, I'll be glad to do it.
(03/10 00:22:31) Brayden: Same here. About Neg.
(03/10 00:22:40) Nick White: If anyone finds out who it was yesterday, I'd love to know.
(03/10 00:22:46) Nick White: Just send me a note.
(03/10 00:22:53) Whilyam: Okay
(03/10 00:22:54) Warren Weisstieg: I think I know, there was a log somewhere, from the D'ni Zoological Society
(03/10 00:22:57) Xavius: I'll use my Luck o' the Irish to give those suckers some *Thick Irish accent.* luck.
(03/10 00:22:58) Zukeenee: Wait... something happened with Neg yesterday?
(03/10 00:23:05) Mystlander blows you a kiss
(03/10 00:23:08) Whilyam: Tweek? Rils? Ring a bell?
(03/10 00:23:18) Joey Zoonishii: Yeah, what's up with Negilahn?
(03/10 00:23:19) Xavius needs a moment to breathe!
(03/10 00:23:24) Warren Weisstieg: Anyone have access to the log from yesterday, i'm sure the name is in there
(03/10 00:23:28) Nebodin: I'm sure that any one of us would like to help with Neg - we are all fascinated by it
(03/10 00:23:29) Anansi: Hello
(03/10 00:23:36) Nick White: I realize that.
(03/10 00:23:40) Warren Weisstieg: Nick, I'll check, I'll be back to you in a second
(03/10 00:23:45) Nick White: I'd like someone with some experience with animals.
(03/10 00:23:45) kami blushes
(03/10 00:23:46) Xavius needs a moment to breathe!
(03/10 00:23:49) Anansi: Check what?
(03/10 00:23:51) Nick White: If anyone has that.
(03/10 00:23:59) Cycreim: Rils does, I believe...
(03/10 00:24:01) Whilyam: I think Rils is the person who you're looking for..
(03/10 00:24:02) Nick White: Why is Kami blushing?
(03/10 00:24:05) Joey Zoonishii: It's odd that Negilahn was opened up... Didn't anyone notice the big crack in the ceiling?
(03/10 00:24:08) Brayden: Not so exotic, I bet...
(03/10 00:24:09) kami: lol...i have experience with dusante....that count?
(03/10 00:24:10) Lydiamalia: Do Horses, dogs and cats count??
(03/10 00:24:15) Dudemom_2000 whispers, "I'm not going outside of that pod!"
(03/10 00:24:16) Nebodin: understandable, i only have experience watching the sky change colour
(03/10 00:24:19) Mystlander roars with laughter
(03/10 00:24:19) DocOlanA: Experience how? Our family bred dogs, and I used to work at a horse farm.
(03/10 00:24:25) Lydiamalia: Oh, and chickens!!
(03/10 00:24:28) Whilyam: I have CAT HERDING EXPERIENCE!
(03/10 00:24:29) Cycreim: Do you want his KI number?
(03/10 00:24:29) Nebodin: which really isnt very useful
(03/10 00:24:34) Xavius: Any chance of there ever being a bahro Stone or Page out of the Pod?
(03/10 00:24:40) Dudemom_2000: yes, cat herding!
(03/10 00:24:41) Mystlander: I have worked with and trained horses?
(03/10 00:24:43) Nick White: Yeah, who was it?
(03/10 00:24:46) Xavius: 00012727
(03/10 00:24:48) Xavius: :P
(03/10 00:25:04) Xavius: I'm a member of the United Kingdom's Stalker's league.
(03/10 00:25:08) Xavius: UKSL.
(03/10 00:25:12) Xavius: MWUHAHAHAHA!!
(03/10 00:25:24) Nebodin: hilarious xavius
(03/10 00:25:30) Joey Zoonishii: So, is there something going on that we should know about, or...?
(03/10 00:25:32) Xavius: Is that sarcastic?
(03/10 00:25:33) Cycreim: Who, Rils?
(03/10 00:25:40) Lydiamalia: 00012727
(03/10 00:25:43) Nebodin: ;P
(03/10 00:25:44) Dudemom_2000: Uh are we talking experience with animals such as hunting or just knowing about animals?
(03/10 00:25:52) Brayden: Anything you can tell us about your meeting with Sharper in Teledahn?
(03/10 00:25:55) Warren Weisstieg: yeah, it was rils
(03/10 00:26:00) Warren Weisstieg: just checked
(03/10 00:26:01) DocOlanA: And I'm very observant with a scientific mind. I'm not a trained biologist or anything, but I'd love to help. Neg is too beautiful to let go to waste.
(03/10 00:26:05) Xavius: There's no guarantee he was with Sharper.
(03/10 00:26:10) Whilyam: Is Sharper going to finally come out ans speak with people?
(03/10 00:26:11) Xavius: he could've been reading his journal.
(03/10 00:26:19) Warren Weisstieg: he said something along the lines of the d'ni zoological society was willing to help
(03/10 00:26:20) Brayden: He said he was meeting Sharper.
(03/10 00:26:28) Whilyam: What's Rils' KI number?
