(03/10 01:37:27) Abathyr: can you tell us anything about the animals in Negilahn or have you had time to look into the predator situation there?

(03/10 01:38:13) Douglas Sharper: Ha
(03/10 01:38:23) Douglas Sharper: Not sure about that.
(03/10 01:38:31) Douglas Sharper: Not afraid of them at least.
(03/10 01:38:33) Abathyr: we just haven't seen much in the way of life there

(03/10 01:39:28) Kazahiro shakes his head
(03/10 01:39:29) Douglas Sharper: I think everyone knew about it a few years ago.
(03/10 01:39:52) Kazahiro: How long has this project been going on?
(03/10 01:39:57) Douglas Sharper: First time Cate came to my office she didn't even knock. Just used the fish tank.

(03/10 01:41:51) Kazahiro: I wouldn't even touch the politics here with a ten foot pole
(03/10 01:41:57) Kazahiro: its bad enough on the surface
(03/10 01:42:02) Kazahiro: down here
(03/10 01:42:11) Kazahiro shakes his head in disgust
(03/10 01:42:20) Douglas Sharper: Let's not go there.

(03/10 01:43:18) Douglas Sharper: You two are the first non-DRC I've seen down here.
(03/10 01:43:24) Douglas Sharper: So there ya go.
(03/10 01:43:31) Kazahiro: we try to keep our distance from those guys
(03/10 01:43:34) Abathyr: we keep hearing rumors that they'll be repairing some areas, but so far it all looks the same
(03/10 01:43:49) Kazahiro: yep
(03/10 01:43:50) Abathyr: heheh, Kaz was just talking revolution a bit ago
(03/10 01:43:54) Douglas Sharper: They've got their hands full. I will say that.

(03/10 01:44:29) Abathyr: yeah, and with so many people running all over demainding new stuff...
(03/10 01:44:32) Kazahiro: they sure do
(03/10 01:44:47) Kazahiro: Its hard to know if there are sides here
(03/10 01:44:55) Kazahiro: yeesha's been running around saying the drc is evil
(03/10 01:44:55) Douglas Sharper: No need for sides.
(03/10 01:45:00) Douglas Sharper: Yeesha...
(03/10 01:45:12) Kazahiro: the drc isnt really acknowledging her
(03/10 01:45:21) Douglas Sharper: Well...
(03/10 01:45:23) Kazahiro: and well...its been a little confusing down here as of late
(03/10 01:45:39) Abathyr: what do you think of Yeesha?
(03/10 01:45:47) Douglas Sharper: I don't know.
(03/10 01:45:51) Douglas Sharper: Don't much trust her.
(03/10 01:45:57) Kazahiro: thats the thing
(03/10 01:46:03) Kazahiro: I dont trust anyone but my friends here
(03/10 01:46:05) Kazahiro: like ab
(03/10 01:46:09) Douglas Sharper: Prefer things I can touch and feel, not this mystical stuff.
(03/10 01:46:17) Douglas Sharper: But she hasn't done anything to hurt me.
(03/10 01:46:23) Douglas Sharper: Seems to be helping here and there.

(03/10 01:47:09) Abathyr: ok, well, nice chatting with you
