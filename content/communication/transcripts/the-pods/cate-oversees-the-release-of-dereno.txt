(03/15 18:00:15) jetuser: Oh yes, by the way, everyone's still wondering about the "wedges" that have seem to taken to appearing in our reltos. What are they exactly and what purpose do they serve?
(03/15 18:00:32) jetuser: And what is this portal that keeps appearing in Neglihan?
(03/15 18:00:41) Cate Alexander: Those are not our doing.
(03/15 18:00:56) TomahnaGuy wonders how Cate knows if ive seen a bahro or not?
(03/15 18:01:01) Cate Alexander: None of that.

(03/15 18:01:07) Cate Alexander: We assume.
(03/15 18:01:12) jetuser: Okay, thanks.
(03/15 18:01:31) Azeltir: Did the DRC see the portal, when it was reviewing the Age?
(03/15 18:01:42) Cate Alexander: Yes.
(03/15 18:01:47) TomahnaGuy: How can the DRC ensure safety on ages like Relto?
(03/15 18:01:53) Cate Alexander: ResEng does this woman need help?
(03/15 18:01:56) jetuser: What is this new age that has shown up on the restoration list, whats the story behind it?

(03/15 18:03:46) Cate Alexander: Not at this time.
(03/15 18:03:49) anju: Cate, is there any concern about future funding?
(03/15 18:03:51) Soup_Fork: does the drcwear the "manitainer suits" when first visiting an age?
(03/15 18:03:54) TomahnaGuy: how can the DRC ensure the safety of ages like Relto?

(03/15 18:08:06) Cate Alexander: I'm not sure we'll ever know.
(03/15 18:08:11) Azeltir: Most that I've seen have been stunning.
