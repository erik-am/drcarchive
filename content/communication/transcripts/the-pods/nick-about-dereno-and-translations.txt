(03/15 02:53:36) Sumatria: do you have a medic going along for the just in case?
(03/15 02:53:43) Nick White: When would you like it put in the museum?
(03/15 02:53:46) sil_oh_wet: Did you catch wind that I was a little envious of Jazz and Heaven getting to spend the afternoon with you yesterday?
(03/15 02:53:49) Sam Byard: ASAP
(03/15 02:53:53) Sam Byard: now if possible
(03/15 02:53:59) Lobo: Are there animal problems in Doreno also?
(03/15 02:54:00) Nick White: I head that through the grapevine - that's why I decided to stop by.
(03/15 02:54:08) sil_oh_wet blushes
(03/15 02:54:10) Myst'Aken: How about midnight tonight
(03/15 02:54:10) Sumatria: how sweet of you
(03/15 02:54:20) Lobo: I apologize for my remarks.
(03/15 02:54:26) Sharaya wants to know what Heaven has that us other girls don't.
(03/15 02:54:30) sil_oh_wet: That was very nice of you to think of me when you have so much on your plate
(03/15 02:54:30) Nick White: What were your remarks?
(03/15 02:54:38) Nick White: I'm a nice guy.
(03/15 02:54:39) Sumatria: that is a real gentleman
(03/15 02:54:41) Jared: nice to meet you Nick
(03/15 02:54:43) Lobo: Oh, in defense of Sil
(03/15 02:54:44) Nick White bows
(03/15 02:54:45) peni: good thinking Nick
(03/15 02:55:10) Sam Byard: would it be possible for dereno to be placed in the museum tonight ?
(03/15 02:55:10) Lobo: Nothing mean about you, really.
(03/15 02:55:11) Nick White: Rils hasn't been around has he?
(03/15 02:55:17) Nick White: It would not be.
(03/15 02:55:20) Nick White: Sorry Sam.
(03/15 02:55:23) Lehm: i haven't seenn him
(03/15 02:55:26) sil_oh_wet: I havn't seen him
(03/15 02:55:28) LdyDrgn: He was around earlier
(03/15 02:55:28) Myst'Aken: Not here
(03/15 02:55:28) Jared: Haven't seen him recently, sorry Nick
(03/15 02:55:29) Sam Byard: tomorrow even ?
(03/15 02:55:29) Brayden: Haven't seen Rils, nope....
(03/15 02:55:44) Nick White: I'm thinking it'll be tomorrow morning some time.
(03/15 02:55:49) DocOlanA: Have you set plans for an expedition into Negilahn?
(03/15 02:55:56) Brayden: Cool. Can't wait to see it.
(03/15 02:55:57) Sharaya: Nick, does it bother you that Sharper is so condescending towards you?
(03/15 02:55:58) Sam Byard: nick this is important. IS there any suspicion that Rils has been kidnapped
(03/15 02:56:00) Nick White: Looking like the next few days.
(03/15 02:56:01) Jared: hope he didn't get too close to the predator in question at Negilahn
(03/15 02:56:05) PiperDriver: Sound like a fun expedition. You need any bait? :)
(03/15 02:56:10) Nick White laughs
(03/15 02:56:11) sil_oh_wet: Giggle
(03/15 02:56:24) Nick White: Not that I know of Sam.
(03/15 02:56:28) Sam Byard: because you and sharper are always looking for him and you never find him !
(03/15 02:56:30) Granelda will go as bait
(03/15 02:56:31) Nick White: I saw him yesterday for a while.
(03/15 02:56:32) Lobo: Volunteering, PiperDriver
(03/15 02:56:34) Sumatria: do need a medic to go along?
(03/15 02:56:45) Nick White: We already have bait - that's what me and Rils are for.
(03/15 02:56:50) PiperDriver: I was actually thinking about you Lobo :)
(03/15 02:56:52) LdyDrgn: Please keep me in mind if you find any reptiles
(03/15 02:56:53) Sharaya laughs
(03/15 02:56:54) Sumatria: you never know someone may shoot themself in the foot...
(03/15 02:56:55) Nick White: Are you a medic?
(03/15 02:56:58) Sumatria: yes
(03/15 02:57:02) DocOlanA: On the one hand, I'm incredibly jealous. The explorer in me really wants to see Negilahn. On the other hand, best to let you guys handle the beastie.
(03/15 02:57:05) Nick White: Really?
(03/15 02:57:07) Lehm: what about hapless sidekick, need one of thoes?
(03/15 02:57:08) Myst'Aken: I have bandages in my closet
(03/15 02:57:11) DocOlanA: Just make sure you're careful out there, Nick.
(03/15 02:57:15) Lobo: Sumatria is Search and Rescue
(03/15 02:57:16) Sumatria: emt in training
(03/15 02:57:27) Sumatria: and sar
(03/15 02:57:30) peni: i always have duct tape on hand
(03/15 02:57:35) PiperDriver nods his head
(03/15 02:57:38) Sharaya: Lol
(03/15 02:57:39) Myst'Aken: And rope
(03/15 02:57:45) Granelda used to train loins for a living
(03/15 02:57:46) peni nods her head
(03/15 02:58:00) Sharaya: Loins? Hmmm.
(03/15 02:58:01) peni: loins sis?
(03/15 02:58:06) PiperDriver: lol
(03/15 02:58:11) Jared: i'm just good for my brain, nothing too physical
(03/15 02:58:14) Lobo: Whose loins?
(03/15 02:58:18) Myst'Aken wonders about gran
(03/15 02:58:23) Sharaya: freudian slip I think
(03/15 02:58:24) peni: ??
(03/15 02:58:28) PiperDriver: roflmbo
(03/15 02:58:38) sil_oh_wet: this may sound silly, but Jazz has a pic with you and your green go-tee, mind if I have one too?
(03/15 02:58:42) Sam Byard: is there any sign of predators in dereno ?
(03/15 02:58:53) LdyDrgn: I've asked Rils to let me know as well if he sees any there
(03/15 02:58:59) Granelda: so i cant spell i can handle large predators
(03/15 02:59:04) Brayden: What kind of wildlife is in Dereno, anyway?
(03/15 02:59:09) Brayden: If any.
(03/15 02:59:09) Lobo: Sumatria, you may need to revive Sil when she swoons.
(03/15 02:59:11) peni: yes she can
(03/15 02:59:13) Sam Byard: brayden, its underwater :)
(03/15 02:59:19) Curty: Hey donna:)
(03/15 02:59:20) Sumatria: I am on standby
(03/15 02:59:27) DocOlanA: Hey Nick, I have a somewhat unrelated question. Do the DRC have access to any old D'ni religious texts?
(03/15 02:59:29) Myst'Aken gets ready for mouth to mouth
(03/15 02:59:45) Nick White: Yeah, we do.
(03/15 02:59:47) DocOlanA: Like the Yahvo equivilant of the Bible or Qu'ran or something?
(03/15 02:59:48) PiperDriver will fight Myst for it :)
(03/15 02:59:49) Brayden: Oh is it? Wow, I love marine stuff. Now I really can't wait.
(03/15 03:00:11) DocOlanA: Any chance that they can get translated sometime soon? We hardly know anything about the actual tenants of their religion, even though it was clear that people like Ri'neref were really into it.
(03/15 03:00:33) Nick White: Yeah, actually some of it is translated already.
(03/15 03:00:36) DocOlanA: Also how the other faiths, like the Tree and such, came into being.
(03/15 03:00:38) sil_oh_wet: well Nicks here lets party!!!
(03/15 03:00:41) DocOlanA: Really? Ever going to release it?
(03/15 03:00:47) Nick White: Yeah.
(03/15 03:00:47) Sharaya: Where has Cate been these days?
(03/15 03:00:53) DocOlanA: When?
(03/15 03:00:55) Nick White: Surface.
(03/15 03:00:55) Sumatria: I love to party!
(03/15 03:00:59) Nick White: And here.
(03/15 03:00:59) sil_oh_wet: Me too
(03/15 03:01:01) Donna nods her head
(03/15 03:01:01) Nick White: Back and forth.
(03/15 03:01:05) Nick White: Busy.
(03/15 03:01:07) peni: party time!!
(03/15 03:01:12) sil_oh_wet: Hooty hoo
(03/15 03:01:12) Sumatria cheers
(03/15 03:01:15) sil_oh_wet cheers
(03/15 03:01:16) DocOlanA: Nick, any timetable on when we'll see the religious texts?
(03/15 03:01:22) Nick White: Sorry Doc....
(03/15 03:01:26) Lehm: nick, any idea what kind of war sharper is referring to lately?
(03/15 03:01:30) Shandi does a dance
(03/15 03:01:33) Nick White: What's that?
(03/15 03:01:36) Lobo: She'd have better standing with the explorers if she made an occasional apprearance
(03/15 03:01:55) Brayden: I've still never met Cate.
(03/15 03:01:55) Jared: Nick, I had a question for you, have any copies of the Rehevkor been found?
(03/15 03:02:12) sil_oh_wet: I saw a picture of her once
(03/15 03:02:18) Granelda wants to give her a hug
(03/15 03:02:44) Nick White: She knows that - she's tryjng to raise money.
(03/15 03:02:47) sil_oh_wet: Oh - I have a picture - it looks like its out in the water in Teledahn -- is it really?
(03/15 03:02:48) White Rose: Do you know how soon you, Rils and Sharper will be leaving
(03/15 03:02:51) Nick White: That's pretty important too.
(03/15 03:02:56) DocOlanA: We've got a group, the KTD, that meets Sunday nights. We've been trying to learn about the D'ni culture and religion of the Ri'neref era, but it's difficult with the paucity of source material.
(03/15 03:02:58) Nick White: Few days.
(03/15 03:03:03) Nick White: Jazz give you that?
(03/15 03:03:03) Curty: Nick, have you heard if we are going to get somemore of the city or City proper opened within half a year?
(03/15 03:03:16) Nick White: Really Doc?
(03/15 03:03:19) DocOlanA: That's why we're interested in translations, even partial ones, of D'ni religious texts.
(03/15 03:03:23) Jared: guess that's a no on the Rehevkor
(03/15 03:03:30) Nick White: Wasn't aware of that gropu.
(03/15 03:03:33) DocOlanA: Yeah. It started three Sundays ago as a bit of a joke, and it turned out really interested.
(03/15 03:03:35) sil_oh_wet: Great idea Doc
(03/15 03:03:37) DocOlanA: Interesting, even.
(03/15 03:04:04) DocOlanA: The problem is, we don't know much about Ri'neref's D'ni. Especially not about the Yahvo faith he keeps talking about. So we could use some translated texts to study.
(03/15 03:04:12) Nick White: Hmm... it was a while ago for lots of that stuff but I'll freshen up. I was looking over it recently because Jazz wanted to know some stuff.
(03/15 03:04:28) Miranna: Hellos everyone
(03/15 03:04:46) DocOlanA: I figure it's difficult to understand the D'ni without understanding their beliefs.
(03/15 03:04:49) Sharaya: You sure know how to draw a crowd Nick. : )
(03/15 03:05:00) Sumatria: indeed he does
(03/15 03:05:03) Nick White: One sec. You'll have to excuse me for a minute.
(03/15 03:05:22) White Rose: Do you have any idea how soon you Rils and Sharper will be leaving
(03/15 03:05:36) Sam Byard: couple of days white rose apparently
(03/15 03:05:49) White Rose: Thanks
(03/15 03:06:04) White Rose: will we be able to see you from our pods?
(03/15 03:06:38) Sam Byard: I'd imagine they would link to a more strategic location and keep in the cover
(03/15 03:06:39) Sharaya: Nick's probably pming Heaven. ; )
(03/15 03:07:03) sil_oh_wet: Hehe
(03/15 03:07:09) Jared: Nick, did you hear my question earlier?
(03/15 03:07:12) DocOlanA: "Lord, they're crowding me again. Yes Lord. Holy fire, Lord? Is that too much to ask?"
(03/15 03:07:17) Kazahiro: GOOD GAWV ALOT OF PEOPLE
(03/15 03:07:18) sil_oh_wet: hes afk
(03/15 03:07:27) Kazahiro: maybe he froze
(03/15 03:07:30) Kazahiro: cause of all the lag
(03/15 03:07:37) Granelda wonders if a Uwin tastes like chicken
(03/15 03:07:38) Kazahiro: because of all the people CROWDING AROUND HIM LOL
(03/15 03:07:40) La'Fitte: shorah
(03/15 03:07:42) Sharaya: We heard you though Jared.
(03/15 03:07:55) Sharaya: It was a good question
(03/15 03:07:57) Kazahiro: cant everyyone give him a LITTLE room
(03/15 03:07:58) Jared: I really want the Rehevkor!
(03/15 03:08:01) Brayden: He said to hold on a moment. He's looking at his KI...
(03/15 03:08:02) sil_oh_wet: Hiya La'Fitte
(03/15 03:08:12) peni: he has a little room
(03/15 03:08:13) White Rose: He is on his KI
(03/15 03:08:15) Granelda says DOH!
(03/15 03:08:37) Kazahiro: I meant....everyone....DISPERESE
(03/15 03:08:40) Kazahiro: scatter
(03/15 03:08:41) Jared: for those who don't know, it's the D'ni lexicon
(03/15 03:08:45) Kazahiro: walk around
(03/15 03:08:47) peni: nope
(03/15 03:08:56) sil_oh_wet: i didnt know that Jared
(03/15 03:08:56) Sumatria: oh okay thanks Jared
(03/15 03:08:57) Sharaya: Oh, that would be awesome Jared
(03/15 03:09:10) Kazahiro: I know how a movie star feels now
(03/15 03:09:11) Lobo: So, Nick, what basketball team are you rooting for?
(03/15 03:09:13) Nick White: Sorry, alright.
(03/15 03:09:15) Sam Byard: welcome back nick
(03/15 03:09:16) Kazahiro: lol
(03/15 03:09:16) Nick White: Oregon.
(03/15 03:09:18) DocOlanA: More than just the lexicon. It was the master primer for the D'ni language. The writers learned from it.
(03/15 03:09:20) Nick White: Go Ducks!
(03/15 03:09:21) Sumatria: wb
(03/15 03:09:24) Stephen C.: Welcme back nick
(03/15 03:09:26) PiperDriver cheers
(03/15 03:09:27) Kazahiro: agreed nice
(03/15 03:09:35) Lobo: Go there?
(03/15 03:09:37) Granelda wants Nicks autograph......for a friend
(03/15 03:09:37) Jared: Nick, about the Rehevkor, have you found any copies?
(03/15 03:09:38) sil_oh_wet: quack quack
(03/15 03:09:38) White Rose: Will we be able to see you from our pods?
(03/15 03:09:42) Nick White: Doc, have you discussed why the D'ni thought the women were much better prophets than men?
(03/15 03:09:48) Kazahiro: all u need is a molotov nick...and the probloem of lagging is solved
(03/15 03:09:52) Granelda: and better looking too
(03/15 03:09:58) Nick White: There were very few men prophets. Very few.
(03/15 03:10:00) peni nods her head
(03/15 03:10:02) Kazahiro: because women are ALWAYS ORACLES
(03/15 03:10:05) sil_oh_wet: Hmmm
(03/15 03:10:06) Curty: Sil_oh_Wet (the woman) rocks!!! :)
(03/15 03:10:07) Kazahiro: men are too stupid
(03/15 03:10:10) Kazahiro: and im speaking from experience
(03/15 03:10:12) DocOlanA: Not yet. We've mostly discussed Ri'neref and the sort of beliefs that led the D'ni to split off from the Ronay in the first place.
(03/15 03:10:12) peni nods her head
(03/15 03:10:13) Granelda: yes
(03/15 03:10:14) Kazahiro: casue im one
(03/15 03:10:15) Kazahiro: LOL
(03/15 03:10:16) sil_oh_wet: Lol
(03/15 03:10:25) Curty: Hey now!
(03/15 03:10:27) Kazahiro: we handle the killing and heavy lifting part
(03/15 03:10:34) peni nods her head
(03/15 03:10:38) Kazahiro: lol
(03/15 03:10:45) White Rose: Will you take pictures of whatever you find?
(03/15 03:10:45) DocOlanA: I can speculate, though. The sacred feminine is a recurring theme throughout many religions, though I'm not sure how many of the biological human functions taht caused women to be associated with oracles apply to the D'ni.
(03/15 03:10:48) Curty: Speak for yourself;)
(03/15 03:10:51) Nick White: Have you talked about taygahn?
(03/15 03:10:51) DocOlanA: What have you found about it?
(03/15 03:10:53) Kazahiro: agreed doc
(03/15 03:10:55) Sharaya: Women are the brains and the beauty
(03/15 03:11:01) Granelda: yes
(03/15 03:11:04) Granelda cheers
(03/15 03:11:05) Kazahiro: i mean look at shiva too
(03/15 03:11:07) Sumatria nods her head
(03/15 03:11:13) Curty: Oh here we go;)
(03/15 03:11:15) sil_oh_wet: So why the difference between men and woman?
(03/15 03:11:15) Nick White: Not sure it was a sacred thing like you are thinking.
(03/15 03:11:15) peni nods her head
(03/15 03:11:18) Kazahiro: why do u think women always made the most proficient assassins?
(03/15 03:11:26) Kazahiro: poison
(03/15 03:11:28) Nick White: More that they were better able to hear from Yahvo.
(03/15 03:11:28) Granelda knows the difference
(03/15 03:11:30) peni: smarter??
(03/15 03:11:36) Donna: and brains!
(03/15 03:11:38) DocOlanA: Why did the D'ni believe that?
(03/15 03:11:39) Kazahiro: and all that good stuff
(03/15 03:11:39) Curty: Women are Awesome! :)
(03/15 03:11:40) Donna: yay peni!
(03/15 03:11:41) PiperDriver: No, just more in touch.
(03/15 03:11:49) Nick White: Alright.
(03/15 03:11:50) DocOlanA: The Great King seemed not to believe it so much, though.
(03/15 03:11:54) Jared: women's intuition is much better i would guess
(03/15 03:11:55) Kazahiro: now there are alot of extremely intelligent men
(03/15 03:11:59) Lobo: Maybe we should take advantage of Nick's knowledge while he is here.
(03/15 03:12:12) Kazahiro: but they cant be hot
(03/15 03:12:12) Shandi nods
(03/15 03:12:13) Sumatria: yes, let's do that
(03/15 03:12:20) sil_oh_wet: but they were obviously given proof time and time again
(03/15 03:12:20) Lobo: We can debate men and women later
(03/15 03:12:22) Sharaya: What do you think Nick?
(03/15 03:12:24) Kazahiro: LOL
(03/15 03:12:25) Nick White: Well the Regeltavok Ahlsendar and the Oorpah are probably the two most important religious books.
(03/15 03:12:26) Granelda knows the guys have a short between the headfones
(03/15 03:12:27) Donna: oh alright
(03/15 03:12:32) Lehm: ilove taking advantage of people
(03/15 03:12:34) Kazahiro: mmhmmm
(03/15 03:12:37) Curty: but us men are warriors and stand in the gap for our Women:)
(03/15 03:12:39) Tetters feels the estrogen count rising...
(03/15 03:12:42) Donna puts a little but goes back to listening
(03/15 03:12:45) Nick White: Alright, you've got a few minutes.
(03/15 03:12:56) Kazahiro: acutally with lions..the women hunt...and the men just take the food LOL
(03/15 03:12:59) Nick White: I've got to make a Dereno trip in a minute.
(03/15 03:13:09) Brayden: Cool.
(03/15 03:13:10) Sam Byard: need a hand nick ?
(03/15 03:13:10) Donna: Can I go?!?
(03/15 03:13:13) peni: i want to go too
(03/15 03:13:13) Kazahiro: I cant even tell which one of you IS NICK
(03/15 03:13:14) sil_oh_wet: Ohhhh Doreno?
(03/15 03:13:15) Brayden: Hahahaha
