(03/14 21:17:02) Douglas Sharper: I've been in the Boston area
(03/14 21:17:38) Mucol: did you have a meeting with Rils, Mr. Sharper?
(03/14 21:17:57) Mucol: (shoud we say Mr. Sharper or Douglas :) )
(03/14 21:18:07) Douglas Sharper: I have met Rils.
(03/14 21:18:13) Douglas Sharper: Seems like a good fellow.
(03/14 21:18:21) Mucol: yes, he is
(03/14 21:18:28) Douglas Sharper: Not the best with a weapon but he does have some experience.
(03/14 21:18:34) BlackNight1172: whre did meet them
(03/14 21:18:54) Douglas Sharper: We were in Teledahn yesterday.
(03/14 21:18:54) Mucol: Is there any creature which is hunting the urwin and the two-tailed-monkey in Negilahn?
(03/14 21:19:02) Douglas Sharper: Nick and Rils.
(03/14 21:19:22) Douglas Sharper: I'm not sure about the whole chain of command there in Negilahn yet.
(03/14 21:19:26) Douglas Sharper: Haven't had enough time.
(03/14 21:19:35) Douglas Sharper: But yes, there are natural predators it would seem to the monkeys for sure.
(03/14 21:19:41) Douglas Sharper: Or at least at one time there was.
(03/14 21:19:55) Juluck: who has built the pod by the way... is it the work of the DRC?
(03/14 21:20:12) Douglas Sharper: As far as I know.
(03/14 21:20:19) Heaven: Is it possible that a predator not native to Negilahn has been introduced to the Age?
(03/14 21:20:41) Douglas Sharper: It is possible.
(03/14 21:20:50) Douglas Sharper: I suppose.
(03/14 21:21:03) Juluck: but by whom?
(03/14 21:21:05) Mucol: you spoke about Teledahn - do you know, if there is any chance, that we will see more areas in Teledahn than we know? You are an expert for Teledahn :)
(03/14 21:21:20) Douglas Sharper: Ha
(03/14 21:21:24) Douglas Sharper: Expert.
(03/14 21:21:42) Douglas Sharper: I don't know.
(03/14 21:21:51) Mikel: If not you, who else :-)
(03/14 21:21:55) Douglas Sharper: Try not to meddle in the affairs of the DRC.
(03/14 21:22:03) Douglas Sharper: Unless they want me to.
(03/14 21:22:11) Mister Cloak: Do you think that perhaps Kate is actually some kind of Werebeast is is feasting on the animals in Negilah?
(03/14 21:22:24) Douglas Sharper: Ha!
(03/14 21:22:33) Douglas Sharper: Cate with a "C" by the way.
(03/14 21:22:39) Mister Cloak: my bad lol
(03/14 21:22:51) Douglas Sharper: Fine by me, just don't let her see...
(03/14 21:23:04) Douglas Sharper: She doesn't like that much from what I hear.
(03/14 21:23:09) Mister Cloak: thanks for the correction
(03/14 21:23:10) BlackNight1172: we are all explores, what can we do to be so good as you
(03/14 21:23:29) gure: hi zusammen
(03/14 21:23:42) Caveman: Hi
(03/14 21:23:51) Mucol: whats your impression of the DRC at the moment
(03/14 21:24:05) Douglas Sharper: The DRC has their hands full. They are working hard.
(03/14 21:24:15) Mucol: thats right
(03/14 21:24:37) Mucol: do you know, if we can do something to help?
(03/14 21:24:41) Juluck: Do you think Cate is a better leader than watson?
(03/14 21:24:52) Mister Cloak: i think most of us just wish that there was something we could do but we know that the DRC doesn't want us in harms way
(03/14 21:24:55) gure: hi
(03/14 21:24:56) Douglas Sharper: Ha! I know a trap when I see one.
(03/14 21:25:18) BlackNight1172: ok
(03/14 21:25:20) Juluck: hehe
(03/14 21:25:23) Mikel: lol
(03/14 21:25:53) Mucol: lets try to translate another moment please
(03/14 21:25:55) Juluck: have you already met a bahro, mr. sharper?
(03/14 21:26:01) Douglas Sharper: Alright...
(03/14 21:26:07) Mucol: moechte nochjemand von den rein deutschsprachigen eine Frage stellen? bitte sagen
(03/14 21:26:18) Juluck: you're the animal expert:)
(03/14 21:26:25) brockmaster: Kugel verlassen?
(03/14 21:26:45) Mucol: do you know, if it's possible to leave the pod?
(03/14 21:26:56) Douglas Sharper: For some.
(03/14 21:27:08) Mucol: aha? what does it mean?
(03/14 21:27:27) Adijike: How
(03/14 21:27:27) Mister Cloak: do you know why the DRC would release a pod when they realized that there was population/predidation problem?
(03/14 21:28:05) BlackNight1172: for some who knows to leave
(03/14 21:28:06) Douglas Sharper: I don't believe the population problem has affected anyone.
(03/14 21:28:11) Adijike: is the pod a way we can see life that became extinct on D"Ni?
(03/14 21:28:11) Douglas Sharper: Has it?
(03/14 21:28:41) Mister Cloak: Aside from some minor Irrataions I don't believe so
(03/14 21:29:10) Adijike: is Negilahn like a live Zoo?
(03/14 21:29:21) Mister Cloak: yes, and we are the exhibit! lol
(03/14 21:29:31) Douglas Sharper: From what I understand, from what Nick has told me, Negilahn was a zoo of sorts.
(03/14 21:29:34) Douglas Sharper: At least the pod was.
(03/14 21:29:52) Douglas Sharper: Taking the small children to the pod for the day to see the wild creatures.
(03/14 21:30:31) Juluck: the children of the DRC? I'm confused....
(03/14 21:30:32) Douglas Sharper: From the sounds of it there used to be plenty to see.
(03/14 21:30:56) Douglas Sharper: No, no. Ha. D'ni children. When this place was in its glory.
(03/14 21:31:19) Mister Cloak: one more question for you good sir
(03/14 21:31:22) Juluck: ah, I see :)
(03/14 21:31:27) Douglas Sharper: Yes sir.
(03/14 21:31:37) Mister Cloak: Once you bag the beast, what do you plan on drinking to celebrate?
(03/14 21:31:43) Mucol: so it wasnt the only one - have you already seen some more pods anywhere?
(03/14 21:31:52) Douglas Sharper: I have not.
(03/14 21:31:56) Douglas Sharper: Nick has.
(03/14 21:32:02) Douglas Sharper: I know they exist.
(03/14 21:32:05) Mucol: ah - great

(03/14 21:34:34) Heaven: Be safe, Douglas
(03/14 21:34:48) Adijike: Goo bye
(03/14 21:35:00) Thend: If you look in the distance you can just make out the wild Sharper returning to his natural habitat
(03/14 21:35:17) BlackNight1172: so many questions are open
(03/14 21:35:21) Mister Cloak: lol he's stuck!
