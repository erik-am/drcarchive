(03/28 23:18:09) Kal: as I was saying
(03/28 23:18:38) Kal: This forum is going to provide a platform for all the Guilds to come together and start communicating on a regular basis, which will help open up discussions for a more formal Guilds system.
(03/28 23:18:43) Kal: but
(03/28 23:18:46) Kal: more importantly,
(03/28 23:19:16) Kal: the goal here is to provide explorers with an easy-access point to join groups that directly correlate to their skills to help the Restoration in the same way the DZS is.
(03/28 23:19:39) Nick White: Hmm... but what are they joining?
(03/28 23:19:52) Kal: a lot of people are bandwagoning the DZS's succes in getting together with you guys, but they don't know the first thing about zoology. Or how to take care of a dead goldfish, for that matter.
(03/28 23:20:24) Kal: People, Guilds I should say, want the same opprotunities as the DZS. not just for themselves, but to provide explorers with the same sort of access to you guys
(03/28 23:20:32) Kal: and when I say 'access' I'm not talking going on hunting trips
(03/28 23:20:41) Nick White: What are you talking?
(03/28 23:20:50) Nick White: The DZS doesn't really have much.
(03/28 23:20:56) Kal: meaning?
(03/28 23:21:08) Kal: much to offer you guys?
(03/28 23:21:13) Nick White: In fact, the DRC hasn't really acknowledged them.
(03/28 23:21:22) Nick White: I mean we've taken Rils on some trips but that's about it.
(03/28 23:21:24) Nick White: Right?
(03/28 23:21:27) Kal: Yeah
(03/28 23:21:31) Nick White: What do all these groups want?
(03/28 23:21:35) Kal: But look at what they're offering you
(03/28 23:21:47) Nick White: I'll tell you this Kal.
(03/28 23:22:01) Kal nods his head
(03/28 23:22:04) Nick White: Guilds are on the horizon. The DRC wants to bring them back.
(03/28 23:22:17) Kal: And open communication between them is a good way to kick-start that, wouldn't you say?
(03/28 23:22:18) Nick White: I'm going to tell you something that you don't need to spread if you want it to matter.
(03/28 23:22:25) Kal: alright...
(03/28 23:22:36) Nick White: We need someone to start pushing for those Guilds to start. A voice to the DRC.
(03/28 23:22:44) Nick White: Not necessarily a group. A voice.
(03/28 23:22:50) Nick White: An expert. Do you know the Guilds well?
(03/28 23:22:50) Kal points to himself
(03/28 23:22:55) Nick White: Well then get on it.
(03/28 23:22:58) Nick White: Start pushing for them.
(03/28 23:23:05) Kal: I don't have intimate knowledge of each Guild, but yes, they're starting to listen.
(03/28 23:23:09) Nick White: Start learning everything there is to learn about them and start hounding the DRC to start them.
(03/28 23:23:15) Nick White: Sometimes they need a kick.
(03/28 23:23:21) Kal: which is what I'm trying to do...
(03/28 23:23:23) Kal: look
(03/28 23:23:28) Nick White: This won't happen overnight but it could.
(03/28 23:23:35) Nick White: Alright, then consider this a first step.
(03/28 23:23:37) Nick White: You talked to me.
(03/28 23:23:38) Kal: The Guilds are very unlikely to start forming up and standardizing if they never talk
(03/28 23:23:40) Nick White: I'll pass it along.
(03/28 23:23:43) Kal: alright
(03/28 23:23:51) Nick White: Cate we'll probably say "Great, we'll get to them when we can."
(03/28 23:23:54) Nick White: End of story.
(03/28 23:24:02) Kal: which is not what's going to help...
(03/28 23:24:12) Nick White: Alright so this forum thing?
(03/28 23:24:19) Kal: yes?
(03/28 23:24:32) From Desert Eagle in Uru Obsession's Bevin: hey... are you in teledahn with Nick?
(03/28 23:24:32) Kal: it's already built. me and Earthwiz have it constructed, we just need to start getting it public.
(03/28 23:24:33) Nick White: That will help. Do it.
(03/28 23:24:38) Nick White: Cool.
(03/28 23:24:39) Kal: ok
(03/28 23:24:41) Nick White: Alright.
(03/28 23:24:46) Kal: sounds good.
(03/28 23:24:46) Kal: see,
(03/28 23:24:48) Kal: the thing was,
(03/28 23:24:52) Nick White: Yes...
(03/28 23:25:00) Nick White: You've got one minute.
(03/28 23:25:02) Kal: it's so much more likely to get attention when the DRC comes out and says, "we want Guilds"
(03/28 23:25:03) Nick White: I've got a meeting.
(03/28 23:25:06) Kal: understood
(03/28 23:25:18) Kal: i mean not so directly
(03/28 23:25:18) Nick White: The DRC isn't saying we want Guilds yet.
(03/28 23:25:30) Nick White: Not more than we have.
(03/28 23:25:31) Kal: but it's a consideration, right?
(03/28 23:25:36) Nick White: It's on the list.
(03/28 23:25:39) Nick White: A big list.
(03/28 23:25:43) Kal: then that's all people need to hear.
(03/28 23:25:44) Nick White: You start pushing it and maybe it'll move up.
(03/28 23:25:48) Kal: if it's on the list, then interest can move it upwards.
(03/28 23:25:51) Kal: exactly
(03/28 23:26:04) Kal: the fact that it's on there will make people look
(03/28 23:26:11) Nick White: Here's what I'm saying. You or you and this guy be "the guys." We don't need another group necessarily.
(03/28 23:26:17) Nick White: Groups have too much red tape.
(03/28 23:26:22) Kal: right
(03/28 23:26:25) Nick White: Cool.
(03/28 23:26:29) Kal: i'm not trying to form a group. I'm hoping people take the idea and run with it.
(03/28 23:26:31) Nick White: We'll be in touch.
(03/28 23:26:34) Kal: sounds good
(03/28 23:26:36) Nick White: Seems like good stuff.
(03/28 23:26:39) Kal: don't be late for your meeting.
(03/28 23:26:42) Nick White: Do you know Sydney?
(03/28 23:26:47) Kal: Sydney who?
(03/28 23:26:53) Nick White: Sydney Austin?
(03/28 23:26:55) Kal: nope
(03/28 23:26:58) Nick White: Alright.
(03/28 23:26:59) Kal: he DRC?
(03/28 23:27:02) Nick White: Take care.
(03/28 23:27:05) Nick White: No...girl.
(03/28 23:27:09) Kal: ah... you're quite the playboy.
(03/28 23:27:10) Nick White: We'll talk soon.
(03/28 23:27:10) Kal: lol
(03/28 23:27:12) Kal: later
(03/28 23:27:14) Nick White: Go with your plan though.
