(03/02 20:40:54) Kato roars with laughter
(03/02 20:40:57) Erik: I've spent some hours in Negilahn.... but haven't seen an animal yet. Do you have some suggestions for luring them?
(03/02 20:40:59) Jan Stepmeir: lol
(03/02 20:41:05) DocOlanA: Yeah, well, we've been debating philosophy and such. And the new age. Nice to know you're working on the doors, though.
(03/02 20:41:13) Kato: Yes, when will some proper Negilahn information be out?
(03/02 20:41:19) DocOlanA: Yeah, have the DRC found anything about Negilahn?
(03/02 20:41:24) Nick White: Not really. The animals have become very skittish and populations have dropped quite a bit.
(03/02 20:41:29) rong: i like it without information
(03/02 20:41:35) Nick White: Not like it used to be there.
(03/02 20:41:42) Jan Stepmeir: Nick have you gotten the so called "Enigma" symbol to appear in Negilahn?
(03/02 20:41:43) krissy: yes
(03/02 20:41:52) krissy: I have
(03/02 20:41:55) Kato: How recently has the population dropped? Since you've been there, or since D'ni fell?
(03/02 20:42:08) Nick White: Since we've been watching it.
(03/02 20:42:09) rong: Enigma symbol?
(03/02 20:42:13) gelf56: something eating them?
(03/02 20:42:15) Kato: Really? Why, do you think?
(03/02 20:42:18) Erik: That's a shame
(03/02 20:42:29) DocOlanA: Have the DRC given any names to the critters?
(03/02 20:42:43) Venus: Perhaps they're not getting enough light?
(03/02 20:42:47) Kato: Do you think it's because of humans returning? Maybe you contaminated them through the ceiling crack.
(03/02 20:42:55) Nick White: Not sure. There are theories going around.
(03/02 20:43:09) Butch: Any theories you can share with us?
(03/02 20:43:22) gelf56: have the drc been outside the pod to find out?
(03/02 20:43:32) Jan Stepmeir: yes, we've spread the plague to them, it happened in South America to the Aztec and it's happening on Negilahn, lol
(03/02 20:43:50) DocOlanA: Ha ha. Don't even joke like that.
(03/02 20:43:53) Kato: Yes, Native Americans here were very vulnerable to European diseases long cured over there.
(03/02 20:43:58) Nick White: There is some evidence of what is happening to them.... it's not pretty.
(03/02 20:44:05) DocOlanA: What is it, Nick?
(03/02 20:44:06) Kato: (When the Europeans came here)
(03/02 20:44:06) Finrel: the aztec were dying when the old world showed up @ it's dooorstep
(03/02 20:44:14) Venus: Oh dear, that's upsetting!
(03/02 20:44:15) DocOlanA: Predation, or what?
(03/02 20:44:17) JC Delacroix: Could it be Bahro related?
(03/02 20:44:33) Nick White: I'm going to have to pull a Kodama here... too early to tell.
(03/02 20:44:40) Nick White: And you know me, I like to talk.
(03/02 20:44:42) Nick White: But...
(03/02 20:44:46) DocOlanA: Well, can you at least tell us what you found?
(03/02 20:44:51) DocOlanA: The evidence, that is?
(03/02 20:44:54) Jan Stepmeir: lol, that's why we like you Nick ;)
(03/02 20:45:08) Butch: Nick, is there anything Explorers should report to a ResEng if we see it in that age?
(03/02 20:45:24) Butch: As in, link out, call for help, get to medical . . .
(03/02 20:45:40) Nick White: Imagine a water buffalo in the sahara a few days after a pride of lions has been through the area.
(03/02 20:45:53) Venus: Yuk!
(03/02 20:45:55) DocOlanA: Ah. So we're definitely looking at predation.
(03/02 20:46:03) Finrel: i think every age should be supplied with an AED! lol
(03/02 20:46:11) gelf56: ewww are we safe with that big crack in the side of the pod?
(03/02 20:46:19) Nick White: Yeah, hate enjoying the conversation but I have a meeting.
(03/02 20:46:23) Nick White: Sorry, I'll come back later.
(03/02 20:46:26) DocOlanA: Do the markings and MO match other known predators in the age?
(03/02 20:46:27) Nick White: Peace out.
(03/02 20:46:31) DocOlanA: Shorah, Nick.
(03/02 20:46:33) JC Delacroix: Later!
(03/02 20:46:35) Kato: Shorah.
(03/02 20:46:36) Kato waves hello
(03/02 20:46:37) gelf56: thx bye
