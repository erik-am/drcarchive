(03/26 14:05:16) TomahnaGuy: Hi solita
(03/26 14:05:22) Nick White: Sharper is on the surface.
(03/26 14:05:26) Nick White: Might be for a while.
(03/26 14:05:36) Andrew Eldred: Why's that?
(03/26 14:05:50) Nick White: Supplies. Training. Not exactly sure.
(03/26 14:05:58) TomahnaGuy: Business as usual then
(03/26 14:05:59) Nick White: It was quick. He just up and left over the weekend.
(03/26 14:06:24) Nick White: Said he needed to get "upstairs".
(03/26 14:06:40) TomahnaGuy: Maybe hes scared that the thing in Negilahn will come to the cavern? :P
(03/26 14:06:42) Andrew Eldred: Strange... several explorers have a theory running around that the "predator" might have been some sort of insect swarm--do you think there were enough marks on the vegetation to suport that?
(03/26 14:06:54) TomahnaGuy: Although sharper doesnt strike me as the scared type
(03/26 14:07:13) Nick White: Could be insects. Could be.
(03/26 14:07:28) TomahnaGuy: You mean the firefl8ies?
(03/26 14:07:29) Kai-Uwe: Shorah!
(03/26 14:07:29) Nick White: I don't think he's scared, unless he's scared he doesn't have the right equipment for the job.
(03/26 14:07:29) TomahnaGuy: Fireflies
(03/26 14:07:34) TomahnaGuy: Shorah Kai

(03/26 14:08:08) TomahnaGuy: Nick may I ask a question that has been bothering some people lately?
(03/26 14:08:08) Thend: Hello all

(03/26 14:09:48) TomahnaGuy: Well I hope we see them soon :)
(03/26 14:09:54) Nick White: Just busy I guess.
(03/26 14:09:58) TomahnaGuy: In a way we kinda miss them
(03/26 14:09:59) Andrew Eldred: Any idea when we might see Kodama again? Not until Minkata is ready?
(03/26 14:10:03) Nick White: Yeah, it's be nice if they stopped by more.

(03/26 14:13:15) Nine-O-Nine starts to laugh
(03/26 14:13:18) ireenquench: hehehe
(03/26 14:13:19) Andrew Eldred: Nick, I think you're insane.
(03/26 14:13:21) Tai'lahr giggles

(03/26 14:13:37) Kazahiro: hmmmm
(03/26 14:13:54) JWPlatt: I'm not paying enough for this great place, Nick.
(03/26 14:13:59) Kazahiro: LOL
(03/26 14:14:04) Andrew Eldred: Hint to Platt: Feathers have been adopted as the new in-cavern currency.
(03/26 14:14:05) Thend nods his head

(03/26 14:15:42) Thend: Nick, is another expedition planned?
(03/26 14:15:47) JWPlatt: I only said companionship, Nick. The rest would be in your own mind.
(03/26 14:15:55) Kazahiro: dun dun dun
(03/26 14:16:06) Kazahiro: how about a brand new tv?

(03/26 14:19:13) Andrew Eldred: Nick, a question about translations: where are the philosophic works? If the D'ni have none, they'd be the only non-nomadic civilization lacking them.
