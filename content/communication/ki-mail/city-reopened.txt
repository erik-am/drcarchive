Explorers,

For those who are not yet aware, a crack was discovered early Saturday afternoon in one of the buildings in the City. Explorers were warned to stay out of the immediate area as a precautionary measure.

Unfortunately, there was a collapse in that area last night at 8:40pm cavern time. The city was shut down to explorers as the damage to the city was assessed.

We have since discovered that two people were inside the building when the ceiling collapsed: Rosette “Rose” Taylor, who apparently was killed in the initial collapse, and Willow “Wheely” Engberg, daughter of DRC Member Michael Engberg. Wheely is still alive. The two had sneaked into the restricted area despite the warnings.

At this time, they are still inside the collapse. The DRC's effort to rescue Wheely continues, but the work is slow. Excavation work is done by hand to minimize the risk of causing another collapse.

In the meantime, since the damage has so far been limited to that one building, we have reopened the rest of the City to the explorers. However, the immediate area around the alley to the Kahlo pub will continue to be closed to anyone not directly involved with the rescue efforts. This will be strictly enforced.

We will provide further updates when more information is available.
