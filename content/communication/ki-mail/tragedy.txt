Explorers,

For those who have not yet heard, there was a collapse inside one of the buildings in the city on Sunday night at 8:40 pm Cavern Time.

Two people were inside the building when the ceiling collapsed: Rosette “Rose” Taylor, who was killed in the initial collapse, and Willow “Wheely” Engberg, who was killed just before the rescuers arrived where she had been trapped.

Our condolences and deepest sympathies go out to the Taylor and Engberg families.

The DRC
