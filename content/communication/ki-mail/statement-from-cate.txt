This week has been full of tragedy. Our wonds are deep, and our scars will never completely heal. I cannot comprehend the loss that Michael is feeling now, but our hearts are with him, and I trust that he will return when he is ready.

There is much that we do not know. But we do know that the restoration we have committed to will fail if we do not overcome our sorrows and conquer our fears.

There is much we cannot control. But we will continue to hold on to those things we can.

And so, we will keep moving forward.

Many have dedicated their lives to this restoration effort, and to give up now would be a grievous offense to the memories of all who lost their lives here and an insult to those of us who continue to work toward a restored cavern.

With that in mind, I have made the decision that Minkata will be released on schedule tonight. We will reverently celebrate its opening as we honor the events of this week. How appropriate that the word “minkata” means “heavily scarred”. May the scars of Minkata be a constant memorial to all we have lost.
