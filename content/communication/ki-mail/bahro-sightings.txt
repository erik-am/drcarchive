Explorers,

The DRC is aware that the number of Bahro sightings in the Cavern and Ages has gone up dramatically every since the two appeared in the Watcher’s Sanctuary yesterday.

Again, we do not want to cause any undo panic, as they have not harmed anyone, but we would like to remind the explorers that very little is really understood about these creatures. Do not take any unneccessary chances if you see one. Please keep your distance from them and take care to not appear to threaten them in any way.

Thank you,

The DRC
