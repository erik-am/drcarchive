Explorers,

The events of the past two months have highlighted the need to have a way to memorialize explorers who are no longer with us. We have installed a memorial near the Kahlo Pub to honor the memories of those explorers.

If you have the name of an explorer who has passed away that you'd like to submit for us to consider adding to the memorial, please send an email with the name of the explorer, their nickname (if applicable) and a brief description of how that explorer impacted you directly, or contributed to the community in general.

Send your submissions to info@drcsite.org with the title “Memorial Submission”.

Also, if you know the full names for those we currently only have nicknames for, please let us know that information as well.

Thank you,

The DRC
