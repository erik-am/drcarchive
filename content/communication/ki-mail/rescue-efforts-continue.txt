For those who have not yet heard, there was a collapse inside one of the buildings in the city on Sunday night at 8:40pm cavern time.

Two people where inside the building when the ceiling collapsed: Rosette “Rose” Taylor, who as far as we can tell was killed in the initial collapse, and Willow “Wheely” Engberg, daughter of DRC member Michael Engberg.

The DRC efforts to rescue Wheely continues, but work is slow. Excavation work is done by hand to minimize the risk of causing another collapse. The rescuers are currently on the third floor of the building, working there way down. If work continues at the current pace, and barring other issues, the rescuers hope to reach where they believe Wheely is by the end of the day tomorrow.
