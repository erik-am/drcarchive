Explorers,

A short time ago, two Bahro appeared in the Watcher’s Sanctuary with what appeared to be the Bahro that Douglas Sharper had killed during his reconnaissance trip to Noloben.

It is not clear what their intentions were, but, so far, no explorers have been harmed by these Bahro. Still, it is a matter of concern, as we do not want to provoke the Bahro and have anything as tragic as has recently happened repeated.

If you see one of these Bahro, please take great care to not startle them or appear to threaten them in any way. It may be best to keep your distance from them as much as you can.
