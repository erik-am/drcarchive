Explorers,

The DRC are thrilled to report that Phil “phend” Henderson has returned safely to the Cavern! He was involved in a major structural collapse a little over three years ago. When his destroyed KI was discovered in the rubble, we feared the worst, and when it was confirmed that he did not have his Relto Book with him at the time of the collapse, those fears seemed to have been confirmed.

We are very happy to have Phil back with us once again.
