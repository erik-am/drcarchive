She wants things done safely, I thought.(02/16 23:24:34) Lord Chaos: Sharper gets along fine with those who see things his way.(02/16 23:24:35) Thend: Sharper will find a way to get what he wants doen(02/16 23:24:35) Kal: we have no way of knowing for sure, but I&#8217;m guessing she&#8217;s not going to mind him all thatmuch if she&#8217;s willing to let him down here again. Sharper&#8217;s opinion of Cate, however, is entirely unpredictable.(02/16 23:24:36) Moiety Jean: How&#8217;d you first meet up with the DRC, Nick?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> Through my sister-in-law.</div></div>

Looks like we&#8217;ve got enough to open it easily<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> Dude I&#8217;m not married.</div></div>
