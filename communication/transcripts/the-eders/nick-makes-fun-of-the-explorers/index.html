(02/20 15:17:21) Thend nods his head<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> It&#8217;s what prevented Delins&#8217; release the first time around.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Pryn:</div> does the DRC think the storms will travel to Tsogahl?(02/20 15:17:21) Leonor: See, Thend, I told you it wasn&#8217;t Yeesha because of us.(02/20 15:17:23) Vortmax: Right, which is what made me wonder if it&#8217;d get closed anow. But I&#8217;m glad it won&#8217;t :D(02/20 15:17:29) rw.: Are we talking what, white out conditions? Blizzard, Nick?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> No, just a nice snow.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Thend:</div> So, Nick, like, does the DRC have a sort of &#8216;Yeesha File&#8217; or something? I mean they MUST know more about her then we do, right?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> Beware of any lamp posts and closets.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Thend:</div> Point taken Leonor ;)(02/20 15:17:59) ireenquench laughs(02/20 15:18:00) Vortmax laughs(02/20 15:18:04) Sosiqui: Hm, maybe I shouldn&#8217;t go back to Relto then(02/20 15:18:10) Sosiqui: that wardrobe, very threatening(02/20 15:18:11) Tallon Enx: :)(02/20 15:18:11) Pauline points(02/20 15:18:23) Pryn: Closets??<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> The Yeesha file is kept in our biggest vault and very classified.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Leonor:</div> Really?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> Only people in suits and black sunglasses can see it.</div></div>
(02/20 15:18:46) Leonor starts to laugh(02/20 15:18:48) Sosiqui has an image of an alternate DRC Kadish Vault(02/20 15:18:48) Vortmax: Hey Nick, out of sheer curiosity, were those cloths and doors in these Ages when you were investigating them?(02/20 15:18:54) zam starts to laugh(02/20 15:18:57) Thend: Is it.. like, dangerous or something?(02/20 15:19:00) Pryn: That means you can&#8217;t sneak it out to show us until after hours in the Cavern - right?(02/20 15:19:07) Grieyls goes off to get black suit and sunglasses<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> Right&#8230;</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Sosiqui:</div> Yes, what Vortmax said, I&#8217;m curious about that myself.(02/20 15:19:54) ireenquench nods her head<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> We saw them sometimes.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> But they seem to have been more permanent once we placed the Books.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Vortmax:</div> That&#8217;s actually more interesting than either the yes or no I expected&#8230;<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> I&#8221;m not sure - I wasn&#8217;t there that often.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Sosiqui:</div> Hm. Interesting.(02/20 15:20:45) ireenquench: Whats your take on them?(02/20 15:20:48) Sosiqui: Maybe it&#8217;s another instancing phenomenon. Especially if the doors were flickering&#8230;<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> But I know we don&#8217;t have much control over that stuff.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Leonor:</div> So it could be that Yeesha is changing the ages as you release them?(02/20 15:21:25) William Clark: woah<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> Yeesha is beyond me. I don&#8217;t know what she can and can not do. Same with the Bahro.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">William Clark:</div> Did I walk into something important?(02/20 15:21:40) Vortmax: She&#8217;s beyond all of us, I think&#8230;<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> But I don&#8217;t think there is much they can&#8217;t do&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Sosiqui:</div> Same with us - but we had to try something. And if nothing else, we had a good time today.(02/20 15:22:00) Thend nods his head(02/20 15:22:03) zam nods her head(02/20 15:22:07) ireenquench: Yah, same here, unfortunatly, yet all these things happen and I really want to get to the bottom of things.(02/20 15:22:08) William Clark: except Dance. Bahro Can&#8217;t dance :P<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> That&#8217;s all that matters, I suppose.</div></div>
