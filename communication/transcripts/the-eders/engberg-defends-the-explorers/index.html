<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">syzen:</div> I&#8217;ve got red ones? Go to the GZ anteroom then? And then Ill do the reading??(02/09 00:51:18) Whilyam: Many opposed to the forums crowded the City, keeping participants out.(02/09 00:51:40) Jeremy: no, if you have red markers, then you&#8217;ve gone over the first 15<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Interesting.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Jeremy:</div> The first 15 are green(02/09 00:51:53) J&#8217;mir: thats stupid, what was the forum about?(02/09 00:51:54) Jeremy: The 2nd set are red.(02/09 00:52:03) Whilyam: If Cate wants numbers, with a few exceptions, all here are for the forums.(02/09 00:52:08) syzen: I have all red ones(02/09 00:52:11) J&#8217;mee: Also, many of us who would have participated in the sit-in were on the surface at the time, due to work obligations(02/09 00:52:25) Jeremy: So you should be able to find 10 red markers presently. The remaining ones are still &#8220;lost&#8221;(02/09 00:52:41) J&#8217;mir: learn us(02/09 00:52:57) syzen: I have 15 though(02/09 00:53:16) J&#8217;mir: go to gz(02/09 00:53:16) BrettM: Mr. Engberg, do you have any idea of how Cate views the purpose and function of the DRC site at this time?(02/09 00:53:17) Whilyam: I think that Cate should remember that the DRC forums, if maintained properly, can be a great way to bring the explorers together to talk about what the DRC has released.(02/09 00:53:22) Chimaera: I have fifteen red ones I think that is all of them so far(02/09 00:53:24) Jeremy: No, you have room for 15. There should be darker and lighter red markers(02/09 00:53:33) Chimaera: I have rrom for five more(02/09 00:53:40) Whilyam: It also has the effect of allowing hte DRC to see what is troubling the explorers.(02/09 00:53:42) Jeremy: Yes. That&#8217;s correct<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Well, regardless of the reason, the result of this morning&#8217;s sit in was to set my discussions with Cate about the forums pretty much back to square one.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">J&#8217;mee:</div> The forums have played such a vital role in the history of the Restoration.(02/09 00:54:23) Shoemaker: Oh ho ho! That sounds about right for Ms. Alexander.(02/09 00:54:24) Jeremy: 10 should be highlighted, and 5 should still be dark, waiting for data to be loaded into them.(02/09 00:54:34) Oren: buggy pile of.....(02/09 00:54:35) Lensy: Why, Mr Engberg or how?(02/09 00:54:38) BrettM: Was she that irritated??(02/09 00:54:41) Shoemaker: She&#8217;s not one for social disobedience, of course.(02/09 00:55:16) BrettM: We&#8217;re very sorry that we had this effect! If we had known of your efforts &#8230;(02/09 00:55:21) Jinglish: How does Cate feel that we should get information?(02/09 00:55:21) syzen: Nope all 15 are highlighted<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I&#8217;ve been talking with her about them for about two hours since the sit-in. I think we are close to a compromise again.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Curty:</div> great!!(02/09 00:55:53) Jeremy: Then re-load them into the 2nd machine and start doing the next part of the quest(02/09 00:55:54) J&#8217;mee: Good news(02/09 00:55:55) Whilyam: Anything we can do to help?(02/09 00:55:57) Lensy: She doesn&#8217;t understand the passion of us, the explorers, for this place and these things(02/09 00:56:01) Shoemaker: What concession does she want, then?(02/09 00:56:12) BrettM: Mr. Engberg, aside from the forums, I am concerned that the site is significantly less information-rich than it was before the redesign.(02/09 00:56:16) Lensy: Why should there be concessions(02/09 00:56:27) Oren: I really wish this chat list would stay closed when i close it(02/09 00:56:37) Shoemaker: Compromise requires concession, Lensy. Let&#8217;s hear what the good Doctor has to say.(02/09 00:57:07) J&#8217;mee: Originally, one could select a year on the site&#8217;s main page (on the timeline) and see old progress reports. I liked that.(02/09 00:57:07) Whilyam: Perhaps this: The DRC has their private area. The DRC also has an area where minor updates (like when you placed Nexus terminals in the Ages) can go. The explorers have their public area.(02/09 00:57:42) Jeremy: Mr Engberg, I&#8217;m sure you understand that we have a different perspective on this endeavor from some other people. I am not one to say that anyone&#8217;s thoughts are more or less valid than anyone elses&#8230; but that there is value to be gained from understanding the thoughts of the other side, whichever side you happen to be on.(02/09 00:57:54) Xana4ok: WOW(02/09 00:57:59) Xana4ok: a lot of ppl(02/09 00:58:05) Whilyam draws Mr. Engberg&#8217;s attention to the group surrounding them.(02/09 00:58:26) Jinglish: There should be a central information resource&#8230;KI mail alone can&#8217;t do the job.(02/09 00:58:30) Jeremy: Those forums gave explorers a chance to get a look at the thoughts of those in, and involved in, DRC.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Yes, Jeremy, I understand that.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Curty:</div> Did anybody notice the small update we got about 5 minutes ago?(02/09 00:59:17) Xana4ok: no(02/09 00:59:17) Jinglish: So what is the next step with Cate?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> For now, just give me a little more time.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Curty:</div> As I was linking to my Relto I got a short updating screen(02/09 01:00:05) Jeremy: If Ms Alexander is concerned with inappropriate content from explorers being posted on your &#8220;professional&#8221; site, I can understand, but wouldn&#8217;t a fair and vaild compromise be to allow anyone to read, but only authorized personnell to post?(02/09 01:00:13) Whilyam: Have Cate count these people, Michael. And they&#8217;re still only a small portion of those who enjoyed those forums.(02/09 01:00:42) Curty: yes Michael we are patient:)(02/09 01:00:50) Whilyam: Aside from letting you have more time, is there anything we can do?(02/09 01:00:57) BrettM: Can you tell us anything about Cate&#8217;s vision for the site?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I would hope so, Whilyam, or there reallly isn&#8217;t a reason to put them up again.</div></div>
(02/09 01:01:11) Lensy is liking Ms. Alexander less and less all the time(02/09 01:01:16) Jeremy: I&#8217;m not even concerned with social, or civic, disobedience. I am merely here to express my thoughts and concerns. Take them for what they are worth, and use them as you see fit.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Thank you, Jeremy</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">BrettM:</div> I would really like to understand where she&#8217;s coming from. It would help us to deal with her better.(02/09 01:02:11) Curty: Yes we really do miss the old DRC posts It really helps to give us Peace of mind&#8230;somewhat Michael(02/09 01:02:27) Jinglish: Well, part of this is that our time for direct communication has been short&#8230;with the DRC, with Cate&#8230;all of which underscores the need for the site as a way to communicate(02/09 01:02:45) Jinglish: But we appreciate you being here tonight!(02/09 01:03:02) Jan Stepmeir: it was a simple power play, she needed to come in and exert her Authority over us protesters(02/09 01:03:03) Whilyam: Cate should also know that, regardless of what she percieves as worth, the loss of those forums will make her VERY unpopular and could sway minds not made up.(02/09 01:03:13) Shoemaker: Rather(02/09 01:03:15) Curty: Helps us to be more patient cause we know more of what is going on as we should helping the DRC and all.(02/09 01:03:18) Lensy: I hhave to agree with Jinglish. We don&#8217;t really have a way to communicate with the DRC now(02/09 01:03:31) Chimaera: I agree with Jinglish(02/09 01:03:38) Jeremy: In any relationshop, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re aware, there is always a need for communication. Even employers must communicate with employees. Definately not on the same level as friends, but it is a flow of information none-the-less.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> BrettM, part of the problem was the lack of moderation. That will be addressed.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Jeremy:</div> And we explorers are certainly in a relationship with the DRC.(02/09 01:04:06) Shoemaker: Hm. That is a valid point. If Alexander doesn&#8217;t plan on restoring the old forums, does she intend to find / use another output?(02/09 01:04:33) Whilyam: I think I understand what she wants to do as well. She wants to make sure that people in the cavern actually want to read the forums and stil lcome down here.(02/09 01:04:34) Jan Stepmeir: the D&#8217;ni left many modes of communication &#8230; the KI, the community center, the imagers etc.(02/09 01:04:41) Lensy: Yes, moderation was a problem, but many explorers would make good moderators(02/09 01:04:42) Kato: Is Engberg still here?(02/09 01:04:52) Whilyam: Right in the middle, Kato(02/09 01:05:00) Kato: Oh hello(02/09 01:05:00) Kato waves hello(02/09 01:05:19) Jeremy: I hope that you can impress that upon Ms. Alexander. We are not her adversaries&#8230; we are allies in the common goal of exploration, discovery, and restoration of D&#8217;ni<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Hello, Kato.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Curty:</div> i do like the controled authority of the DRC &#8230;I do think we need to know what direction this train is going(02/09 01:05:26) J&#8217;mee agrees with improved moderation.(02/09 01:05:50) Jinglish is fine with that.(02/09 01:06:18) Whilyam: Cate may also want to know that there are some who depend on the forums for information regarding the restoration when they are away on vacation or at work.(02/09 01:06:34) Curty: It would be nice to know where Cate is going with this Restoration so we are not walking blind....(02/09 01:06:38) Loganblue: Well then do they need new liasons or something? I mean, they old ones were done away with.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I believe she understands that.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Lensy:</div> Yes, most of us can&#8217;t be here 24/7(02/09 01:07:19) Lensy: And I perferred the DRC forums over some of hte other ones(02/09 01:07:31) Lensy: for all its warts and such(02/09 01:07:39) Whilyam: Also, sure, anyone can make a forum. But it&#8217;s the fact that the DRC have a forum that makes it more appealing. It also educates explorers about the DRC.(02/09 01:07:41) Jan Stepmeir: Michael keep your eyes on Cate, don&#8217;t let her boss you around and use your work to make profit by selling artifacts and technology(02/09 01:07:43) OlracUK:<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I did too, Lensy.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">OlracUK:</div> shorah all(02/09 01:07:47) syzen Susan agrees for the need for the forums(02/09 01:07:51) Jeremy: I think it would be unreasonable to ask for daily Ki-mail updates&#8230; the forums are much more concise. And less intrusive for those who would rather not have their KI flashing constantly(02/09 01:08:04) Jinglish: There are so many forums&#8230;DRC felt more &#8220;need to know&#8221; sometimes(02/09 01:08:12) Lensy: or who can&#8217;t be there to get KIMail(02/09 01:08:19) Jinglish: Right(02/09 01:08:41) BrettM: I feel that the problem is more than just the shut down of the forums.(02/09 01:08:58) Jinglish: What, Brett?(02/09 01:08:59) Whilyam: Yes, it&#8217;s removal of the Sights and Sounds and other info as well..<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Well, I need to be getting back to work, just wanted to give an update on the forum progress.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Shoemaker:</div> General attitude of Alexander towards the explorers, Brett?(02/09 01:09:13) Curty: i think we need to trust Cate a little more.....(02/09 01:09:20) Whilyam: Such as the results of many of the contests.(02/09 01:09:21) BrettM: We seem to have lost a lot of history. Where on the site is John Loftin mentioned, for example?(02/09 01:09:21) Lensy: Yes, BrettM I think it is. It is not having been asked first if this was a valuable resource to the explorers or not(02/09 01:09:24) Jinglish: Thank you, Michael(02/09 01:09:25) J&#8217;mee: Thanks, Mr. Engburg!(02/09 01:09:33) Whilyam: Well thank you for the chat, Michael(02/09 01:09:33) J&#8217;mir claps his hands(02/09 01:09:35) Jan Stepmeir: &#8230;just a word to the wise&#8230;(02/09 01:09:35) Whilyam thanks you(02/09 01:09:35) Jeremy: I am willing to trust her. I wish that she would have trust in me as well.(02/09 01:09:36) Chimaera: Thanks for dropping by, Michael(02/09 01:09:36) brobitail: ty Mr. Engberg for your time(02/09 01:09:36) BrettM: Thanks for your time.(02/09 01:09:37) Lensy: Thank you Mr Engberg<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Take care, everyone. </div></div>
