But I&#8217;m stubborn I suppose.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I don&#8217;t like that the forums are down either.</div>

A lot of good informational posts were there that we&#8217;d like to keep for posterity.(02/06 21:42:57) Whilyam: Glad to hear that(02/06 21:43:07) Whilyam: Yes, there was much progress made there.(02/06 21:43:14) Gadren: Shorah!<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Just ashame to lose the forums - on top of everything else.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">URU_Plum:</div> i hear u five by five(02/06 21:43:44) Whilyam: Understand, but please stop.

<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Hu K&#8217;hanDhat:</div> any news on the light in the docks section mr. engberg?(02/06 21:44:40) E&#8217;nitra: Well the let her know we do!!(02/06 21:44:51) Myst&#8217;Aken: She didn&#8217;t really give us time to respond yesterday<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Yeah it was Cate&#8217;s idea, but she had other support.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Whilyam:</div> Aye. Tell her she&#8217;ll have riots soon if she doesn&#8217;t have some sort of forum up.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> But I didn&#8217;t agree.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Whilyam:</div> I liked seeing small reports of progress.(02/06 21:45:42) Sorceress: Maybe if there was an active effort to moderate the DRC forums, there would be less trolling there. I left because I couldn&#8217;t stand the nasty atmosphere there.(02/06 21:45:54) Whilyam: I also miss the Sights and Sounds section. That&#8217;s pretty much gone too.(02/06 21:46:05) Sorceress: I know, add yet anohter job to the pile.(02/06 21:46:15) Berric: the fact to be all here together is cause of lags<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I might not threaten her with riots, but I will express some of your opinion if you don&#8217;t mind.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Whilyam:</div> Thank you.(02/06 21:46:31) Ural: Any video live from the cavern?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> You should also make it clear to her when she&#8217;s around down here.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Whilyam:</div> She WILL have problems, though, if this keeps up.(02/06 21:46:50) Whilyam: I will. I just haven&#8217;t seen her much.(02/06 21:46:53) Hu K&#8217;hanDhat: ok, we will do that &#8230;(02/06 21:46:55) Sorceress thanks you very much!(02/06 21:46:57) E&#8217;nitra: oh we will!(02/06 21:46:59) Whilyam: I&#8217;m busy myself.(02/06 21:47:15) Marjan: But.... we have a lot to thank her for as well haven&#8217;t we?(02/06 21:47:27) Sorceress: Just remember guys, a little politeness goes a long way fi you mention this to Cate.(02/06 21:47:29) Hu K&#8217;hanDhat: agree with yoiu Marjan(02/06 21:47:31) Marjan: Without her funding....<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I do agree with you all. I may be slow on the cavern and age release, but the forum removal seems unproductive.</div></div>
(02/06 21:47:51) Whilyam shrugs(02/06 21:47:51) Whilyam: I&#8217;m glad she came. Doesn&#8217;t mean shredding a good forum is okay by me.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> No need to be rude. Cate gets things done. But she listens&#8230; generally.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Whilyam:</div> Michael: One thing that surprised me is that you said most of these decisions end up with you being the only detractor. I would think Dr. Kodama would oppose releasing unsafe areas. Has something changed?(02/06 21:49:08) Cosmo: hi everyone(02/06 21:49:17) Whilyam: Shorah, Cosmo(02/06 21:49:22) Marjan: She knows how to get a train moving ....:-)<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I&#8217;ll be pushing from my direction. We&#8217;ll see.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Sorceress:</div> Hi Cosmo(02/06 21:49:50) Berric: can we have other avatar&#8217;s head cause the one i have is not representing mine<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Dr. Kodama and I agree and disagree. But we seem to get along just fine.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Donna:</div> forgive me if already asked, but what is the library&#8217;s status?(02/06 21:50:44) Amrak: I am sorry, but she funds, and that&#8217;s all she cares about in my<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Actually I was here to do a final library insprection.</div></div>
(02/06 21:50:52) Donna cheers(02/06 21:50:54) Whilyam claps his hands(02/06 21:50:57) Hu K&#8217;hanDhat: mr. Engberg, any news on Sharper since we last met a few days ago?(02/06 21:50:57) Sorceress claps her hands(02/06 21:51:00) Rima cheers(02/06 21:51:08) Myst&#8217;Aken: Need any assistance ?(02/06 21:51:12) E&#8217;nitra: Lol(02/06 21:51:12) Donna: opening soon then?(02/06 21:51:18) Amrak: Sooner than friday?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I don&#8217;t keep up with Sharper and the rumors.</div>
(02/06 21:51:52) Donna shivers with anitcipation(02/06 21:51:58) Sorceress yawns(02/06 21:52:23) Whilyam: Michael, there&#8217;s been a pestering question about Watson. Do you mind if I ask you about it?(02/06 21:52:25) Hu K&#8217;hanDhat: but, don&#8217;t let us stop you from you insdpection &#8230;<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Just trying to be safe on the library. I error on the cautious side. But there is a lot of pressure to open it soon.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Hu K&#8217;hanDhat:</div> We all are anxious to see the inside of the library(02/06 21:53:08) Amrak: No pic?(02/06 21:53:08) Sorceress: And maybe finally go down the stairs all the way!(02/06 21:53:13) Amrak: ok then<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I haven&#8217;t heard from Dr. Watson at all.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Whilyam:</div> Back at one of the first Town Halls, the DRC said that news about Watson should &#8220;wait until the community is healed&#8221; or something to that effect. Yet now you say we&#8217;ve heard nothing. What did the DRC mean by that first comment?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> It&#8217;s a shame he&#8217;s not around. He was always a voice of reason.</div></div>
(02/06 21:54:20) Thumbs up from Amrak(02/06 21:54:33) Hu K&#8217;hanDhat: and nobody in the DRC does have his most recent Mobile Phone number? Too bad(02/06 21:54:58) Marjan: maybe he&#8217;s on Yeesha&#8217;s journey?(02/06 21:55:07) Gadren: For two years?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I think we were just referring to the fact that we didn&#8217;t really want to spend time worrying or contemplating what might have happened.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Gadren:</div> Even I&#8217;m not that bad a puzzle-solver(02/06 21:55:25) Marjan: Lol(02/06 21:55:36) Prometheus: How long was Phil gone?(02/06 21:55:42) Whilyam: Ah.
