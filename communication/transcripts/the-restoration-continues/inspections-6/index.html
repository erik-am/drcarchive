<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">zia:</div> after yesterday who could blame him(12/20 19:46:42) zia: yes, Dr. We understand<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> Talking to some Res Engineers</div></div>

<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> We woudn&#8217;t have it open otherwise.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">zia:</div> that&#8217;s good(12/20 19:47:25) Lynh: should we be concerned about the bahro now?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> We are still investigating areas though.

<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> He was noticing strange abnormalities in the Lattice.</div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> Very odd yesterday.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Lynh:</div> yes, very odd(12/20 19:48:48) ireenquench: Ah ok.

<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> People have expressed frustration at the barricades - I understand.</div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> But hopefully they won&#8217;t be long.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">ireenquench:</div> It is good to be back yes. Although the incident makes me wonder whats going on&#8230; the Bahro screech indicates its not just some lattice malfunction?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> No the lattice malfunction was a result of something. Not a cause.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> What, we don&#8217;t know yet. Looking into it.</div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> Hopefully we&#8217;ll have something soon.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">zia:</div> and the bahro could just have been reacting to the same thing(12/20 19:50:54) ireenquench: Oh, I see&#8230; so a lot more than our bodies was affected? Anything else besides the lattice abnormal?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> We&#8217;re still looking into things. I hate to speculate as rumors begin&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">ireenquench laughs(12/20 19:51:33) Lynh: yes, rumors, there is always that(12/20 19:51:35) zia: what, from us :)(12/20 19:51:43) ireenquench: Asking questions gets you to the bottom of things , doesnt it?[Dr. Kodama wanders off to the book room, stands there for a while and links out, without speaking to the explorers any further]</div></div>
