<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Thought I might drop by and discuss something that you&#8217;ve noticed, and the DRC has noticed&#8230;</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Guru:</div> I&#8217;m all ears.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> but that we haven&#8217;t really talked about much.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">kami:</div> what is that victor(12/22 13:26:08) Nadnerb: let the man finish..<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Do I need to shout? Or can everyone hear me?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Lyn&#8217;et:</div> i can hear(12/22 13:26:32) kami: shout please(12/22 13:26:40) J&#8217;ffrey: lound nd clear Vic(12/22 13:26:53) Mireena: can&#8217;t hear(12/22 13:26:54) Skyhawk: hello(12/22 13:27:04) ireenquench: yes, please shout or the ones by the ferry won&#8217;t hear you<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Can everyone up here hear me?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Liander:</div> Jap(12/22 13:27:40) Matthew Miller: Yes, I can hear you fine(12/22 13:27:42) borg1985: i can(12/22 13:27:43) Nadnerb: aye(12/22 13:27:45) amy: i cant(12/22 13:27:46) J&#8217;ffrey: Yes(12/22 13:27:49) 4runner: yes(12/22 13:27:50) Aikien: naye(12/22 13:27:50) BlackRaven: Yes(12/22 13:27:52) Lyn&#8217;et: I hope(12/22 13:28:31) amy: i cant hear you<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> I will shout and hope that I don&#8217;t interfere with peopel exploring.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Matthew Miller:</div> anyone at the ferry, laxman has a important annoucment at the very top of the stairs(12/22 13:28:56) jolly: are(12/22 13:29:07) ireenquench: I think he means if we can read what our KIs transmit as text.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Not really an announcement per se, just a chat. Part of the kindler/gentler DRC. :)</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Matthew Miller:</div> Ah, okay :)(12/22 13:29:34) Nadnerb: ah, nice. :)(12/22 13:29:41) kami: oh yes..we are so apreciative of the openess(12/22 13:29:48) Matthew Miller: Indeed<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Many of you are aware that the DRC members have taken the Yeesha journey&#8230;</div></div>
(12/22 13:30:33) PapaBear cheers<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> and we are more open to accepting things we can&#8217;t explain right now.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Matthew Miller:</div> That&#8217;s good to hear(12/22 13:31:04) J&#8217;ffrey: Nice(12/22 13:31:29) jolly does a dance<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> One of the things that we can&#8217;t explain is the multiple age occurances (what some have taken to calling instances)&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> We have no idea how Yeesha can do many of the things that she does. The multi-ages is one of those things.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">kami:</div> it is no coeincedence then(12/22 13:33:28) Nick: what are we doing here?(12/22 13:33:39) Guru: Such as the 2 Kadish vaults correct?(12/22 13:33:42) Spaz342: Finding answers, I presume?(12/22 13:33:43) ireenquench: Is there anything we can do to help you investigate this further? In Kadish for example? The occurrence is really odd there.(12/22 13:34:12) Nick: I hope he has a lot of answers&#8230;<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> The DRC has experienced this first hand in Relto, and we embrace it, even without understanding it - much like you have.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">kami:</div> wow..........that is wonderful victor(12/22 13:34:51) Alfred embraces it<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Ireenquench brought up a question regarding Kadish and the vault for example. It appears that&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Matthew Miller:</div> Every relto is different for everyone. Thats what he means<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Yeesha certainly can do things in remarkable ways. And that&#8217;s yet another example of it.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">jolly:</div> like yeesha tells us&#8221;our relto is special&#8221;<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> But the primary reason I wanted to bring this up is that recently we seen another variation of &#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> this &#8220;instancing&#8221;. We&#8217;ve been hesitant to mention it, although some of you no doubt have&#8230;</div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> seen it as well.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">ireenquench:</div> You speak of the brown book to some city locations?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> It appears that Ae&#8217;gura itself is experiencing the multi-age instancing&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">jolly:</div> just as i thought<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> but in some unique ways&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">kami:</div> yes....but we have also found a solution to this(12/22 13:38:31) Lyn&#8217;et: are you going to be taking these barriers down soon?(12/22 13:38:39) Spaz342 yawns(12/22 13:38:54) Nadnerb: I notice you still do not carry a relto book. how have you completed the journeys then?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> For now it appears that the Nexus is tied to the city we&#8217;re in right now&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">jolly:</div> is the Nexus a instance too?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> But it appears that links to the city from Relto go to other instances. And certainly you &#8216;ve seen this behavior.</div></div>
(12/22 13:40:43) ireenquench nods her head(12/22 13:40:54) Lyn&#8217;et nods(12/22 13:40:58) Nadnerb nods his head(12/22 13:41:01) Spaz342 shrugs<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> It simply appears that the Ae&#8217;gura book that Yeesha has somehow so graciously provided in our Relto&#8230;</div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> is following a similar pattern to the other books. Not exactly the same - but similar.</div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> So we wanted to simply address this now, so that you all know that we are aware of this&#8230;</div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> and we&#8217;re examining all of the repercussions&#8230;</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">kami:</div> what repercussions do you speak of victor?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> But it seemed unique enough that we wanted you all to understand what we understand at this point.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Spaz342:</div> We&#8217;ll know when they happen I suppose(12/22 13:43:53) Lyn&#8217;et: Yea. what repercussions?(12/22 13:44:24) Nadnerb: they&#8217;re still being examined of course..<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Well Kami, it might be odd to explore the city and not find large groups in it. It could be confusing.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Lyn&#8217;et:</div> Yes!(12/22 13:44:58) ireenquench: And you speak of Yeesha&#8230; any idea if she is around, like now?(12/22 13:44:59) kami: oh....i see&#8230;and yes it was disconcerning at first<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Yes Jimbo - and now I have to kill you.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> :)</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Matthew Miller:</div> lol(12/22 13:45:21) Nadnerb: but that would only occur if we use yeesha&#8217;s book(12/22 13:45:31) Matthew Miller slowly slides away from Jimbo(12/22 13:45:32) Spaz342: I didn&#8217;t see anything Jimbo(12/22 13:45:32) jolly: rofl(12/22 13:45:34) Nadnerb: not the nexus. so it&#8217;s predicable then.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Well it certainly might come in handy. But we all should be aware of it.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Aikien:</div> didn&#8217;t see a thing(12/22 13:45:52) Lyn&#8217;et: see what?(12/22 13:46:12) Alfred: I&#8217;m reminded of the reprecussions of the &#8216;sharding&#8217; of Britania. Nasty business that&#8230;(12/22 13:46:25) jolly: i wont tell anyone where u hide his body<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> So I see that you all are going through the same exercise we are - trying to find the patterns of predictability.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Lyn&#8217;et:</div> I&#8217;ll help hide the body(12/22 13:46:44) Matthew Miller: But if these &#8220;instances&#8221; exsist with no people or few people compared to the main city. Where exactly are these cities located? On the same earth? How?(12/22 13:46:47) Spaz342 laughs(12/22 13:46:52) Lyn&#8217;et: Sorry Jimbo(12/22 13:46:57) Spaz342: Not me. I don&#8217;t understand much of what&#8217;s going on.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> That Matthew is exactly what we&#8217;re wondering.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Matthew Miller:</div> Thats a rather shocking and important discovery if true Garymuc(12/22 13:47:43) Aikien: maybe dropping offline....into a d/l uru<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> The engineering side of me jumps to a parallel universe type of explaination&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">jolly:</div> do you think theres a way to sync these ages? if yeesha created these instances, do you think she might be able to to sync them?(12/22 13:48:08) Orbmu2k: yeesha copied the &#8220;real world&#8221; simply to an age :)(12/22 13:48:09) kami: we can see our neighbors in these instances(12/22 13:48:16) Guru: If I may ask a question.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> but I have no idea if it&#8217;s quantum related or not.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Nadnerb:</div> well, based on the D&#8217;ni idea fo the great tree, all of the &#8220;instances&#8221; are slightly, even imperceptibly different.(12/22 13:48:49) Guru: Laxman, do you suppose that the age Relto itself has an effect on the books within it to create these instances?(12/22 13:48:49) Matthew Miller: Indeed writing is far more powerful than just moving through space if you can move through time and dimensions as well<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Another reason we bring this up, is that we could use your help in finding the patterns and making them known.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Nadnerb:</div> it seems to have that effect on all ages linked to from the shelf(12/22 13:49:38) Lyn&#8217;et: Does that mean you will be removing these barriers soon?(12/22 13:49:40) Spaz342: What type of patterns?(12/22 13:49:50) Matthew Miller: I&#8217;d be more than willing to help as I&#8217;m sure most of us would be. How can we help?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> I&#8217;ve spent some time in another &#8220;instance&#8221; of the city and I&#8217;m not sure if others can get to it&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Nehm&#8217;o .:</div> en ville certaz<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> or if only I can.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">jolly:</div> to play on what mat said, maybe for each person who uses the links to the instances it takes them to a different time(12/22 13:50:28) Lyn&#8217;et: If it means I can explore more of the city, I&#8217;ll help(12/22 13:50:35) jolly: kind of a exilation(12/22 13:50:36) Nadnerb: perhaps a link could be provided to the main city areas in the yeesha book. then we could see the people in the instances ourselves.(12/22 13:50:48) Spaz342: If you can be more specific in what to look for, I&#8217;ll lend a hand.(12/22 13:51:07) Nadnerb: I would guess that we would see our neighbors, based on what I&#8221;ve seen(12/22 13:51:09) kami: so our inability to share the city book with others ..that sort of thing?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> I realize that currently there are only a few locations accessible in the other instances, but it&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> still might be possible to determine some information.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Lan:</div> is the DRC working on making The Wall in Gahreesen fully functional again?(12/22 13:51:59) Nadnerb: It really ought to be possible to share the city book. someone should tell yeesha that.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> And we&#8217;re working on something that opens up more of those other city instance areas.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Nadnerb:</div> but all we&#8217;ve seen of her is that hologram(12/22 13:52:22) Spaz342: If she wanted it to be, she would do it.(12/22 13:52:32) Matthew Miller: That would be great Mr.Laxman(12/22 13:52:38) Nehm&#8217;o .: laxman est la(12/22 13:52:43) Nadnerb: excellent!(12/22 13:52:43) Curty: Awesome !!!!! thank you:)(12/22 13:52:47) Guru: She did show up in the cleft when the rain came.(12/22 13:52:48) kami: oh....what is &#8220;something&#8221; victor?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Yeesha makes her own rules, and we assume she has reasons for them. But we&#8217;ll do everything&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> we can to explore within those rules.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">kami:</div> that makes sense......yeesha rules(12/22 13:53:26) kami laughs(12/22 13:53:34) Nadnerb starts to laugh(12/22 13:53:34) jolly: she probibly has the rulse to prevent destruction again(12/22 13:53:48) Curty: thanks Dan&#8217;ni(12/22 13:53:49) Spaz342: or enable it....<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> So as you can see, it was just a little chat to disclose what we&#8217;ve found and&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Nadnerb:</div> but she say&#8217;s it&#8217;s coming..(12/22 13:53:55) ireenquench: Victor I understand you want us to investigate the instances and tell others how the linking to them works and affects them but I have another question: I would like to know what factors made you come to the conclusion that the incident on Tuesday (not only the mass link) was a &#8220;Bahro thing&#8221;.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> encourage you to explore the same thing we are.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Matthew Miller:</div> Thank you for the information Mr.Laxman. Nice to know the drc are willing to share what they are exploring as well<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> ireen - I&#8217;m not sure we know it was a Bahro thing, but becasue of the Bahro &#8220;activity&#8221; (more frequent screams leading up to the event)&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Lyn&#8217;et:</div> Some of us have never experienced these instances you speak of.(12/22 13:55:37) Curty: are we not able to jump from the roof top anymore?...........<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> we feel like certainly it would be naive to think they weren&#8217;t somehow related.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alfred:</div> If the universe is infinite and god is also infinite, and taking into account worm hole theory&#8230; would you like a cheese and ham Bravel?(12/22 13:55:50) kami: yes.........it appears to be a more friendly dr.......makes me smile(12/22 13:56:13) Arthur Kalnins: Dr. Laxman, can you tell us who the &#8220;Cate&#8221; Dr. Kodama was meeting with was?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> That is really all I have for now. I&#8217;m off to get some more improvements in the KI.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">kami:</div> thank you victor<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman:</div> Thank you all for so much patience and support!</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">amy:</div> thanks for all that(12/22 13:57:17) Arthur Kalnins thanks you very much!(12/22 13:57:20) Matthew Miller: What type of improvements?(12/22 13:57:20) Aikien: yes plz(12/22 13:57:22) jolly: Dr., do you think the Barho are any form of threat?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Victor Laxman waves</div></div></div>
