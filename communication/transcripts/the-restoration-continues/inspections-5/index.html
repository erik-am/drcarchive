<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Emgee:</div> i&#8217;d rather explore as things open&#8230;and not be in charge of searching parties to find lost rogue explorers(12/20 13:16:38) Whilyam: but?(12/20 13:16:43) susanszy: lol@Emgee<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> It won&#8217;t hurt to have things closed for a bit while we check the extent of what happened yesterday.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Dr. Kodama:</div> It shouldn&#8217;t be long.</div>
