<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Ian Watson:</div> How&#8217;s the cavern looking? I know there were some fears of instability after the Bahro scream the other day.(12/22 17:59:33) vid: You&#8217;re a very popular lady, I&#8217;m sure. I know all the ResEngs want your phone number in their KI :P(12/22 18:00:43) amonre: Why do I always become hungry at night? It&#8217;s like I need something after dinner. >_<(12/22 18:01:22) Junee: It depends on how long after dinner it is ;)<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Ian, we&#8217;re still in the process of determine what state everything is in.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">vid:</div> I think I&#8217;m going to start trying to make a chart of the splitting occuring in Ae&#8217;gura&#8230; it might be helpful&#8230;<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> So far, things don&#8217;t look too bad, but some of us have learned to be more cautious than others.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">amonre:</div> splitting?(12/22 18:02:44) Ian Watson: I can certainly appreciate that.(12/22 18:02:46) Veralun: hi All(12/22 18:03:02) vid: Yeah.... Victor was speaking about the city being broken up earlier. Different people going to different parts of the city, and for all purposes it seeming to be a different city altogether.(12/22 18:03:04) J&#8217;iim: victor mention the discovery of multiple instance of the City. However the nexus seemed to rooted in the one we know(12/22 18:03:30) Shamgar cheers(12/22 18:03:42) vid: That makes sense, since the Nexus would carry D&#8217;ni books&#8230; while it&#8217;s Yeesha&#8217;s books that take people to different &#8220;versions&#8221;<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> I was actually on my way to the city to talk about that, when I received the private messages.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Maurus:</div> well, that&#8217;s true&#8230;(12/22 18:04:01) Butch: Marie: can you give us an estimate of how much of the city the DRC has reviewed since the incident?(12/22 18:04:09) J&#8217;iim: good point. Yeesha played a prominent role in Victor&#8217;s talk(12/22 18:04:13) Ian Watson: If there&#8217;s any way for us to help with repairs or such, I&#8217;m sure many of us would jump at the chance.(12/22 18:04:22) vid: Marie, any information you can share regarding that would be most appreciated.(12/22 18:04:27) Maurus nods his head(12/22 18:04:55) J&#8217;iim: however he never said when the barriers would come down <frown><div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Thanks for the offer, Ian.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Butch, I don&#8217;t have an overall estimate. Different folks are looking at different areas.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dusante:</div> Wow Marie, and so many of you, haven&#8217;t seen you all for a long time! Hello!<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Engberg might have a more comprehensive view of the overall picture.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;ni:</div> So what interesting are you currently working on, Marie?(12/22 18:06:16) Julian Lapis: Hiya folks(12/22 18:06:27) Dusante waves<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Dan&#8217;ni - at the moment splitting my time between Eder Delin and Ae&#8217;gura.</div></div>
(12/22 18:07:02) Ayli waves(12/22 18:07:10) vid: Dr Sutherland, of course we both know that a lot of explorers have been carrying the Relto book that we found years ago for&#8230; well.. years. But a lot of new explorers have them also, and they don&#8217;t seem to be in the cleft anymore. Is the DRC supplying Relto books as a safety measure now?(12/22 18:07:20) Julian Lapis: Shorah Marie!(12/22 18:07:50) Maurus: Marie, what do you think of Delin and Tsoghal?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> vid - no, we&#8217;re not supplying them. We&#8217;re not opposed to them, but we&#8217;re not distributing them ourselves.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Junee:</div> Is there any chance we might see Eder Delin soon?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Maurus - I&#8217;m particularly fond of Eder Delin, but Eder Tsogal is nice, too.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Julian Lapis:</div> Marie, whats your personal take on the events of the 19th? Do you think that we, as explorers, are in any danger?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Junee - Yes. Probably. Of course, &#8220;soon&#8221; is a relative term.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Given that we&#8217;ve been working on it for months, what seems like &#8220;soon&#8221; to us may not seem like &#8220;soon&#8221; to you.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;ni:</div> So &#8220;soon&#8221; as in weeks? or months?(12/22 18:11:45) Ian Watson: Given that many of us have been involved in the cavern going on three years now, six months could be &#8220;soon,&#8221; and I&#8217;d be happy with that.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Julian - I hope the explorers are not in danger. We&#8217;re certainly doing our best to take what precautions we can.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;ni:</div> Cause I&#8217;m sure you &#8216;re not referring to days. :)(12/22 18:12:13) Ayli: As Mr. Rand likes to say: &#8220;In a future&#8221; :)<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> But it&#8217;s impossible to know for sure how much danger any of us are in.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Ian - given that definition of &#8220;soon&#8221;, I think Delin will definitely be available within that time frame. :)</div>
(12/22 18:13:23) Ian Watson cheers(12/22 18:13:46) Julian Lapis grins like a goodun(12/22 18:14:31) Dan&#8217;ni: One thing that I&#8217;ve always been curious. Did the DRC find out where the Bahro screams actually come from?(12/22 18:14:48) Jeff Klinger: Bahro, obviously. ;)(12/22 18:14:52) vid: I always assumed from Bahro :)(12/22 18:14:57) Ian Watson snorts<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> But before Eder Delin&#8230; what I actually was heading to the city to talk about&#8230;</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Ayli:</div> What are the biggest concerns at the DRC at the moment, Ms. Southerland?(12/22 18:15:01) Dan&#8217;ni: Yeah but they must be hiding somewhere close(12/22 18:15:04) Dan&#8217;ni: ;)(12/22 18:15:13) Kam Uraki: If I might say something. I&#8217;m glad you enjoyed our DRC Public Safty Association videos, Ms. Sutherland(12/22 18:15:16) Ian Watson: Yes, Marie?(12/22 18:15:37) Kam Uraki: Vortmax told me he passed them along to you. :)<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> I know Victor was in earlier. We have been discussing trying to get the doors to the Gallery open.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Ayli:</div> That is great :)(12/22 18:16:38) vid cheers(12/22 18:16:38) Dusante: Wow that is great news!(12/22 18:16:39) Julian Lapis: Interesting!(12/22 18:16:43) Dan&#8217;ni: Awesome!(12/22 18:16:44) Veralun: that would be great!(12/22 18:16:46) Ian Watson: Oh. Wow. That&#8217;d be nice; I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve seen them open&#8230; well, ever.(12/22 18:16:49) Kam Uraki: Oh really? I thought that was not possible.(12/22 18:16:50) Dan&#8217;ni: About time too! :)(12/22 18:16:52) Ural: Awesome!!(12/22 18:16:52) Jeff Klinger claps his hands(12/22 18:17:07) Dan&#8217;ni: Any success with that, Marie?(12/22 18:17:08) Kam Uraki: Did you guys just find the keys or something? ;)(12/22 18:17:14) Julian Lapis: What are the practicailities? Is there a lot of work needed?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> We&#8217;re hoping that we&#8217;ll have them working sometime next week.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;ni:</div> Awesome!(12/22 18:17:33) Jeff Klinger cheers(12/22 18:17:35) Veralun cheers(12/22 18:17:36) Brandeline: Anything is possible with a couple sticks of dynamite.. but they are awful nice doors to be blown off their hinges. ;)(12/22 18:17:38) Junee: Nice :)(12/22 18:17:41) Julian Lapis: Now THIS is legendary(12/22 18:17:50) Ayli thinks its an excellent news :)<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Something for you all to be looking forward to. :D</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Kam Uraki:</div> lol Brand(12/22 18:18:03) kami: dang you guys have been on the journey(12/22 18:18:05) BrettM: Dr. Sutherland, have you had any reports of missing people?(12/22 18:18:05) Veralun: will us give that an extra instance to the city Marie?(12/22 18:18:07) Dan&#8217;ni: So the rest of the city will also be opened soon then?(12/22 18:18:15) Ian Watson: That would be fantastic. I would assume that would also mean access to the second floor of the Gallery?(12/22 18:18:19) Kam Uraki: I&#8217;ll consider that a nice holiday gift from the DRC<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Brand - um, yes, we&#8217;d prefer to get them working without damaging them.</div></div>
(12/22 18:18:52) Brandeline scuffs. Sorry, couldn&#8217;t resist. :)(12/22 18:19:08) kami: victor said that several of you have taken the journey marie.....did yu??<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> BrettM - I was very concerned about that, in fact. But no one I&#8217;ve asked has known of anyone missing.</div>
(12/22 18:19:24) BrettM thanks you(12/22 18:19:37) amonre: always travel in pairs ;)(12/22 18:19:40) Julian Lapis: How has Kodama-san been today? He sounded a little riled yesterday.(12/22 18:19:41) Kam Uraki: Ms. Sutherland, sort of an odd question. What is the purpose of that light on the Arch?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> If you know of anyone who&#8217;s still missing, please let me know.</div>

If you ask me, you&#8217;ve all done a fine job without Dr. Watson(12/22 18:21:33) Kam Uraki: In fact an awesome job(12/22 18:21:55) Ian Watson: Indeed. I certainly can&#8217;t complain.(12/22 18:22:00) Jeff Klinger: Still, it would be good to see him back.(12/22 18:22:01) Dusante: Yeah you guys have been doing great, your work doesn&#8217;t go un appreaciated despite what a few might have been saying<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Marie Sutherland:</div> Kam - thank you.

<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Julian Lapis:</div> It really does feel like things are moving forward.
