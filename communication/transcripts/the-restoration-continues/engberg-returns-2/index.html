<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Well, the DRC is a bit split on that issue - opening things up. And I have to admit that I&#8217;m one of the more cautious ones. My daughter spends time down here and so&#8230; well you understand</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">ian1:</div> We don&#8217;t know that it was the scream that caused it. It could have been something else.Do&#8217;Tsahvahn: I hope this incident hasn&#8217;t cost you too much family time. Especially this time of year.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I was on the surface with my daughter until today.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;nee:</div> How is she?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> She&#8217;s fine. She&#8217;ll be joining me on Saturday I belive.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;nee:</div> Great!<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> If everything works out.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">ian1:</div> How often does she come down here to the cavern?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> She comes down on occasion. She&#8217;s been in school. But coming back down now for a while. She loves it down here. Hard to keep her away.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">ian1:</div> I can see why<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I know shes met some of you - but I don&#8217;t know who.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;nee:</div> What is your particular job with the DRC, Michael Engberg?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I&#8217;m a structural engineer by trade. Comes in handy. So me being late didn&#8217;t help with getting things inspected and open. Sorry.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;nee:</div> What were you doing, if you don&#8217;t mind us asking?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Just now?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;nee:</div> that held you up &#8216;till today<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Oh, on the surface I was spending time with Wheely while she was wrapping up school.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Do&#8217;Tsahvahn:</div> Shopping for last minute gifts?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> No time for shopping.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;nee:</div> Some much needed vacation, I suppose<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Well, I like it down here as much as any vacation. But every now and then&#8230;</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;nee:</div> What school is Wheely attending? I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;m getting too personal, but we&#8217;re all interested in the DRC and the restoration<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> High School in Portland.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Branan:</div> Oregon? or Maine?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Oregon, that&#8217;s we&#8217;re from. She&#8217;s been suffering through school, wanting to get back down here.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;nee:</div> Believe me, we understand.Branan: I know that feeling all too wellAnalord: Funny you choose that word. You make it seem you agree she would be better off down here than in school.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Well, I&#8217;ll be &#8220;home schooling&#8221; her down here for her next semester.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Branan:</div> You can learn the history of the Multiverse down here. Far more interesting than algebraAnalord: That would be an awesome experience. So much for public school&#8230;Do&#8217;Tsahvahn: So that&#8217;s why the classroom imagers are back on&#8230;Alan: May I ask you something about the members of the DRC?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alan:</div> have some or all of you participated in Yeesha&#8217;s journy?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> We&#8217;ve all participated in Yeesha&#8217;s journey. I think we&#8217;ve all changed a bit. We started with some pretty preconcieved notions about things. I think we&#8217;re more open now.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Analord:</div> That&#8217;s nice to hear.Alan: May i ask why you don&#8217;t carry your relto?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I do. You just can&#8217;t see it.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Do&#8217;Tsahvahn:</div> Sorry to hear that.Dan&#8217;nee: No, he means he carries his Relto. You just can&#8217;t see itDo&#8217;Tsahvahn: Er&#8230;<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Sorry, you can&#8217;t see my Relto. But I wouldn&#8217;t be caught without it.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">ian1:</div> Is the govornment aware of the existance of D&#8217;ni?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I have no idea on the governments awareness of this place. They certainly haven&#8217;t sent any funding.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alan:</div> May I inquire about how your perceptions have changed between before and after taling the journy?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Perceptions at first were very steeped in what we knew. I think we&#8217;re more open to&#8230; what we don&#8217;t know and understand now.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alan:</div> Thanks you.Ragdrazi: magic?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Well, some might call it magic. I prefer to think we just don&#8217;t understand it.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;nee:</div> Have you heard any more from Yeesha lately, that we haven&#8217;t?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> We&#8217;ve heard what you&#8217;ve heard regarding Yeesha.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Branan:</div> Are the areas closed off just closed for inspection, to make sure nothing&#8217;s collapsed over the past couple years, or are there other reason related to the recent linking Event?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Most of the closed areas are that way for inspection. We had some minor damage, or at least&#8230; we want to make sure it was only minor.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Ragdrazi:</div> Shouldn&#8217;t we ~all~ have hard hats.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I&#8217;m glad to see some of you wearing the Santa hats I brought down today.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Do&#8217;Tsahvahn:</div> Was there some sort of seismic event when we all linked?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I think there were all kinds of events when the link happened.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alan:</div> thanks fer the hats Michael.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Actually I had selfish reasons for the Holiday decor - Wheely. She&#8217;ll love it.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Do&#8217;Tsahvahn:</div> Is the damage at least consistent with a seismic event?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Some of the damage is consistant with a seismic event, and some of the changes aren&#8217;t explainable&#8230; by anything I know of.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Do&#8217;Tsahvahn:</div> Interesting.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> But that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re looking into. Victor said he saw some kind of spike on the lattice as well. I don&#8217;t even really know what that means&#8230; except it messed up some KI stuff, and imager stuff I believe.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">ian1:</div> Can you give an example of one of the unexplainable changes?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Well some things just changed. Things that were in certain places were gone, and/or moved. I&#8217;m sure you noticed the neighborhood had some items missing. We&#8217;re looking for those items.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Branan:</div> I know all of you at the DRC are busy, but do you think you could talk to Mr. Laxman about giving a presentation on how the Lattice system actually works? I&#8217;m sure that many of us are curious about what exactly it is we wear on our hands<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I&#8217;ll talk to Victor about that. I might learn something, too.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Branan:</div> thanks<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Great Zero is being inspected as well. I&#8217;ll be heading up there in the next few days. I have no idea what to expect.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alan:</div> Didn&#8217;t one of the DRC members earlier say that those items had been removed for some reaosn? is that not true? did they just disapear?ian1: Were all of the missing items a result of the incident or did you remove some?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> We turned things off, but didn&#8217;t really move things.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> And things haven&#8217;t really dissapeared, they&#8217;ve just been rearranged. Or they show up again. Very strange. Although we&#8217;ve seen this before. On a smaller scale.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Analord:</div> I have to go.. It was very nice to meet and speak wit you Mr. Engberg&#8230;[eChip jumps down from the Tokotah roof onto the ground below]<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> eChip your safty is in your own hands back here.</div></div>

And all the DRC<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> It&#8217;s a marvelous place, the city proper. But in much worse condition than here. There are many more areas here to open before the city proper.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alan:</div> you do realize that being patronised aout our safety is not endearing.>? I mean its my responsibility to look after my self. why am i not allowed to decide whats safe for me?Kero: I just want more places to explore<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> We&#8217;ll finish up our inspections, and try to get on to some other places and ages. We know you want them soon.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Do&#8217;Tsahvahn:</div> What is beyond the gate tunnel by the Ferry Terminal?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> It goes over below the concert halll. D&#8217;ni used to sail their boats over there and listen to the concerts in that canyon. Must have been magnificent.</div></div>

Thanks for chatting. It&#8217;s nice to see so many of you.</div></div>
