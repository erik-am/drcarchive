Can you give us any info on your findings, and if we will ever have the chance to explore the Age that was rendered so beautifuly in Riven? (07/06 21:45:56) DRCLVortmax1: Remember, if you have a question, PM me with &#8216;question&#8217;.

Do you think the restoration will be completed by the end of the year? What can you tell us about the age itself? <div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I think Negilahn could be restored very soon. However, the DRC disagrees sometimes. THey worry about the creatures of the age. I guess its good to be cautious. :) Next </div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">DRCLVortmax1:</div> Hailah? (07/06 21:56:20) hailah: The two books in the Museum - I forget what the ages are supposed to be called - maybe Negilahn is one? Will they be accessible? <div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> They are on the list. The timetable changes due to resources given to the DRC. Someday they will be open. Next </div></div>

Has that distinction pretty well disappeared? <div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Well we were upset because we wished we had a better way to handle it. I think we want anyone who fells like joining us down here should. We need your support.. and as KOdama says &#8221; Your money&#8221; </div></div>

At one time I heard rumors that the D&#8217;ni used pods of some kind to explore the age. Will be allowed to freely roam the age ourselves or are the pods still a necessity? <div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Pods seem to be needed.

Could you give us some information on the native airborne creatures, and the D&#8217;ni game/sport they were used in? <div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> THe creatures and landscape itself seem to live off each other.

<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> The house in the paintings belongs to the guild of Illusions . Remember those drawings are artist renditions of a place and of rumors. THe place doesn&#8217;t look like that anymore. </div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> The rumors that the Guild house can be found in other ages have been documented on various occasions. THe DRC are investigating those claims. JUst an FYI. Next </div>

As Er&#8217;cana has fallen into ruins since i last saw it. Safety systems need to be replaced , but I think we can get everyonce help to feed the lake.
