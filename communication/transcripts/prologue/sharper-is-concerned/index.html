<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Miroku:</div> Are they really THAT sensitive?(11/26 18:43:54) Alan: Of course you can.(11/26 18:43:54) Rivenchan: I wont tell(11/26 18:44:00) Guiun: I don&#8217;tknow, can you?(11/26 18:44:00) Rivenchan: ^_^(11/26 18:44:13) VuVo: *no one will tell*<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> I don&#8217;t know many of you or where you stand. I talk as though you all have issues with the DRC and that isn&#8217;t smart.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Many of you could go to them with things I&#8217;ve said.</div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> That gets me in trouble.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Rivenchan:</div> I think a lot of us arn&#8217;t exactly pleased with how the DRC is handleing us(11/26 18:44:42) Alan: I have issues with the DRC treating me as if I were a 2 year old unable to take care of myself.(11/26 18:44:52) Guiun: I love the DRC(11/26 18:44:55) Guiun: :P<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Well a lot have issues and a lot don&#8217;t.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">VuVo:</div> Why would you be saying things the DRC wouldn&#8217;t like?(11/26 18:45:20) Guiun: Except they&#8217;re a little to lax.(11/26 18:45:25) Guiun: too lax(11/26 18:45:37) Guiun roars with laughter(11/26 18:45:45) Miroku: I have concerns about the way they are handling things.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> The DRC is touchy. Any little thing can be taken as &#8220;bad&#8221;.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Many do.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Rivenchan:</div> If you don&#8217;t want to talk about the DRC, we could talk about Yeesha and Zandi ^_^ I&#8217;m sure they wont mind if we say bad things about them, would they?(11/26 18:46:19) Alan: Could they keep you out of D&#8217;ni if they wanted to, Douglas?(11/26 18:46:23) VuVo: So your advise is what exactly?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> I know Yeesha wouldn&#8217;t care.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Daedalus:</div> I don&#8217;t see how anyone would have the power to kick someone from D&#8217;ni(11/26 18:46:57) Daedalus: i dunno(11/26 18:47:08) Miroku: I worry that they are in danger of becoming power-drunk(11/26 18:47:08) Rivenchan: I meant the DRC - the DRC doesn&#8217;t seem to enjoy what Zandi&#8217;s doing(11/26 18:47:15) Daedalus: they&#8217;re not governing, just restoring(11/26 18:47:27) Alan: Well I noticed that Douglas isn&#8217;t wearing a Linking book like the rest of us.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> No advice really. Just follow the line for now.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Rivenchan:</div> So i doubt they would mind what your opinions of Zandi and Yeesha are(11/26 18:47:34) Daedalus: but they ACT like they&#8217;re governing<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Zandi: the guy bugs the DRC and I like that.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Yeesha: dead lady so I don&#8217;t care much.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alan:</div> We don&#8217;t have much choice about following the line until they get rid of more of these cones and barricades anyway.(11/26 18:48:24) 75th Trombone: Well it is sorta their gig. I mean I have &#8220;issues&#8221; like anyone else, but I haven&#8217;t seen anything egregious enough to warrant quite THIS much consternation&#8230; &#8230;maybe I&#8217;ve just not paid enough attention(11/26 18:48:34) Rivenchan: I&#8217;ve heard rumors that Yeesha isn&#8217;t really dead(11/26 18:49:01) 75th Trombone: so&#8217;ve I<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> I&#8217;ve heard rumors she is really dead.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Rivenchan:</div> Who all thinks she&#8217;s really dead?(11/26 18:49:25) Miroku: I have every intention of following the rules, but I want to know why the rules are in place. The word &#8220;safety&#8221; is not sufficient to allay my fears.(11/26 18:49:32) Guiun: I hope she&#8217;s dead(11/26 18:49:37) Alan: Good point, Miroku.(11/26 18:49:38) Rivenchan: Have you found journals confirming it?(11/26 18:49:39) Guiun: *is evil*<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Not me.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Rivenchan:</div> Has anyone?(11/26 18:50:24) VuVo: Not one way or the other.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> She&#8217;s supposed to be two hundred and some years old or something. What more proof do you want?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">VuVo:</div> 350 wouldnt&#8217; be unknown.(11/26 18:50:49) 75th Trombone: We don&#8217;t know how the long d&#8217;ni lifespans may or may not have been diluted in Yeesha&#8217;s genes(11/26 18:50:51) Alan: Uh, don&#8217;t the D&#8217;ni live longer than that?(11/26 18:50:54) Miroku: Time IS relative.(11/26 18:51:01) Rivenchan: (laughs) you are talking about a decendant from a race that routinely made it to that age(11/26 18:51:04) Guiun: she&#8217;s not d&#8217;ni<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Yeesha has a touch of the D&#8217;ni blood.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Rivenchan:</div> Long life might be a dominant trait(11/26 18:51:23) Alan: Well Catherine was only supposed to be slightly less longer lived than Atrus.(11/26 18:51:30) Guiun: Heh - she&#8217;s touched all right....(11/26 18:51:32) D&#8217;ehgan: but not pure D&#8217;ni(11/26 18:51:35) VuVo: I hope I look that good at 200(11/26 18:51:38) Rivenchan: i mean, we dont exactly know how long gehn, sirrus, or achenar lived<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> And Atrus didn&#8217;t live that long.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alan:</div> And Yeesha being their daughter, she&#8217;s 3/4 D&#8217;ni.(11/26 18:51:49) Rivenchan: How long did Atrus live?(11/26 18:51:51) 75th Trombone: How long DID Atrus live? And how did he die?(11/26 18:52:07) devon: Catherine wasn&#8217;t D&#8217;ni.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Atrus was 1/4 D&#8217;ni.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Rivenchan:</div> umm.. so?(11/26 18:52:20) Alan: Ok, I knew my math had gone sour somewhere.(11/26 18:52:34) Alan: (like, 15 years ago)(11/26 18:52:43) Rivenchan: just because my mother is 5 ft and my dad is 6ft doesn&#8217;t mean i have to be 5&#8217;6&#8221; ^_~<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Either eway I don&#8217;t buy women living 200 years and running all over Ages.</div></div>

<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alan:</div> Good, cause didn&#8217;t Marie write that she thinks she met one?(11/26 18:53:41) Jensen: who did you meet that you talked about in you journal?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> I&#8217;m not going to fudge my opinion to try and gain friends like the DRC.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">D&#8217;ehgan:</div> aaaaaaaaa(11/26 18:54:07) Rivenchan: But you&#8217;re fudging your opinions because youre afraid of the DRC(11/26 18:54:12) 75th Trombone: Sounds like you&#8217;re slightly fudging your opinion=---- yep<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> DRC is being real quiet. But I think they&#8217;ve met one.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alan:</div> He&#8217;s not fudging, he&#8217;s just not giving his opinions.(11/26 18:54:46) D&#8217;ehgan cheers(11/26 18:54:55) VuVo: Careful Doug. This might be one of those things that will come back to haunt you.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Not fudging my opinion - fudging my public voice.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Miroku:</div> I don&#8217;t want you to tell me what I want to hear, I want to know the facts.(11/26 18:55:06) Alan: Douglas, just speculation, but might the D&#8217;ni not like the fact that we&#8217;ve taken up residence in their ancestral home?(11/26 18:55:11) Rivenchan: Have you heard any news recently about the D&#8217;ni survivor?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> If you want to talk in private, I&#8217;ll be glad too.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> I wouldn&#8217;t.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Rivenchan:</div> I&#8217;d love to talk privately ^_^(11/26 18:55:35) Miroku: I&#8217;d like that.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Alan - I wouldn&#8217;t.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Alan:</div> Yeah, me either&#8230; Food for thought.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Maybe one of you should start a place where we can talk about the DRC without their knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">75th Trombone:</div> I was thinking about that yesterday(11/26 18:56:13) Alan: How can we do that?(11/26 18:56:13) Guiun: the d&#8217;ni wouldn&#8217;t have a say in us being here. they blew up the place and left(11/26 18:56:32) Rivenchan: News spreads like wildfire in this carvern - if the DRC keeps their ears open, they&#8217;d find out about anywhere we could start up(11/26 18:56:46) Alan: Guiun, most of them were forced out by the plague, weren&#8217;t they?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> There is always something on the surface.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">D&#8217;ehgan:</div> thier ears and eyes are everywhere(11/26 18:57:03) Guiun: lol sure - that&#8217;s what they WANT you to think(11/26 18:57:11) 75th Trombone: birds&#8230; ..beasts&#8230; ;)(11/26 18:57:14) Rivenchan: no offence, but the DRC also has internet access ^_~(11/26 18:57:30) Alan: What we really need is an Age that the DRC doesn&#8217;t know about.(11/26 18:57:30) Rivenchan: Unless we passcoded everything, i think it would be silly to assume the DRC wouldn&#8217;t find out<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Well that&#8217;s the tough part isn&#8217;t it?</div></div>

<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Guiun:</div> lol(11/26 18:58:52) Rivenchan: I said that can find out anything, i didn&#8217;t say that they were intentionally watching us<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Please.</div></div>

<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Rivenchan:</div> If the DRC is always watching us, is it even safe to discuss this here?(11/26 19:01:48) Miroku: What about someone&#8217;s Relto?(11/26 19:02:02) Alan: Well its not like I&#8217;m saying here, go to this NASA forum and start a DRC discussion thread&#8230;(11/26 19:02:06) 75th Trombone: Doug might not appreciate that..(11/26 19:02:17) 75th Trombone: Alan> we get it ;)<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Douglas Sharper:</div> Only if someone from here tells them what was said.
