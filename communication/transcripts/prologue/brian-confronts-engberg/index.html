<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> okay Brian what did you want to talk about?</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> I was interested in discussing the state of affairs down here&#8230;<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  cool  Brian what would you like to know?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Dan&#8217;ni:</div> hey Mr. Engberg or can I call you Mike? ;)<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Dan, ya</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> why are you keeping information from us?Brian Fioca: i realize you&#8217;re working hard on restorationBrian Fioca: but, with all the silence and delays, and delays about silence&#8230;Brian Fioca: it doesn&#8217;t help your cause about sticking to the rules when you go about breaking them yourself<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> OKay  Brian what information do you want?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> What have you discovered about the creatures, the Bahro?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Why do you want to know that?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> ha! because we would like to explore it!<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  So Brian you asked to talk about the state of the cavern, but now you want information on the Bahro?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> I think they have something to do with what&#8217;s going on with Phil.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Why do you believe that? Could you tell me your theory?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> I think they have something to do with what&#8217;s going on with philDusante: we were told they would effect the restorationBrian Fioca: we don&#8217;t even know if they&#8217;re a danger to us<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  we know those ages are safe</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> why? because that way you can make sure we don&#8217;t find out your secrets?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  the ones with the stamp</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">IMForeman:</div> They mean made safe, Brian.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  Brian don&#8217;t assume you know everything, I said safe</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> the advantage you have with this dictatorship of yours is you can wipe all of the ages clean before anyone gets thereBrian Fioca: i don&#8217;t know everything! ha! that is the problem<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> again assuming</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> there are others who agree with me on thisBrian Fioca: many<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  Honestly if you really wanted to know state of  the cavern thats fine, but to assume and belittle the DRC. Well I just don&#8217;t have time for it</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">IMForeman:</div> I agree with Michael.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  Thank you IMF</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">IMForeman:</div> No probBrian Fioca: what is the state of the cavern then?Brian Fioca: the state of the cavern?  i&#8217;m interested nowBrian Fioca: how are things down here?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Well, the state of the cavern, currently we opened the courtyard.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> sighBrian Fioca: really?Brian Fioca: what are the plans for the next opening?IMForeman: The DRC have been very kind and polite to me since they invited me here.IMForeman: It&#8217;s the brigade of people Zandi let in that have been assuming some grand conspiracy<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> The nexus has been having some problems, and we are working on the KI more everyday.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> good.  upgrades?Brian Fioca: to the ki?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Laxman has been working on a few things, Its talked about in his BIO on the website, www.drcsite.org</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">IMForeman:</div> Michael, do you know what state K&#8217;Veer is in?  Has restoration started on it. IMForeman: Last time I asked Kodama, it wasn&#8217;t being touched yet<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> IMF, I am currently in Er&#8217;cana  so I don&#8217;t really keep up on other areas</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> and the library?IMForeman: Ok.  Thanks.Brian Fioca: okBrian Fioca: when will that be openBrian Fioca: rough guess<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">To Michael Engberg:</div> Sorry for interrupting. But I have heard reports that the library was once opened to the explorers. A simple explanation on why it was closed again will help. I have heard many conspiracy theories from your critics.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> John, I will address this Publicly..</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">John Lynch:</div> Okay. Thanks.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Some people have said that other areas of the city were open and are now closed</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> If explorers  were in those other areas, this was before the cavern was open to the public.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> understood<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Some might have heard that its not open now, but with the major amount of public we needed to close areas off.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Sorry for the inconvience.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">John Lynch:</div> Aaaah. So your restricting areas to ensure visitors don&#8217;t destroy important artifacts by accident until you can secure the area better?IMForeman: Or get killed, John.IMForeman: I can understand that&#8230; how many people do you think that Bridge would support at once?IMForeman: Particularly that rope one<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> IMF who really knows, or wants to find out?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">IMForeman:</div> Not me&#8230;plinthon: could we have access to a map&#8230; so we can identify some of thestructures?IMForeman: There was one here once. <div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I&#8217;ll talk to the DRC about giving a map out.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Maybe even put it  on the site.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">IMForeman:</div> The last thing that anyone needs down here is for an Explorer to be killed by unsafe structures.IMForeman: Best to play it a bit cautious[Note: Brian Fioca sends a private message to Michael Engberg]<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Brian, I don&#8217;t leak anything..</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> loose lips sink ships</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> interestingBrian Fioca: so you do have something to hide then?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  Its just a saying..</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> i seeBrian Fioca: that it is<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  again its just a saying.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> yupBrian Fioca: you&#8217;re right<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Brian, I will bring up the concern about giving more information out</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> Thank you MichaelBrian Fioca: that&#8217;s all we askBrian Fioca: it&#8217;ll make a differenceBrian Fioca: butBrian Fioca: it has to be doneBrian Fioca: no more delaysJohn Lynch: Mr Engberg. Just a small question. Could you explain why certain information needs to be kept secret or slowly released to the public? I have read transcripts where you said it&#8217;s important to slowly release the information. I can&#8217;t understand why though&#8230;<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> John, Dr. K is thinking about giving all the information about ages out.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  I just believe that giving some information at a time is better then  all at once.</div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> we will see what the DRC agrees with.</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> why is that?Brian Fioca: what possible reason is there for that?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Well, Say I only knew your name</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> which you doBrian Fioca: :)<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  Its hard to explain, let me try my best</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">John Lynch:</div> Thanks a lot for taking the time out from your important work in Er&#8217;Cana Mr Engberg. It&#8217;s greatly appreciated.Brian Fioca: sureBrian Fioca: i&#8217;m a reasonable person<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> say we  know age names of 50 places</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> yes we can give out those names.</div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div>  but wouldn&#8217;t it be better to really research the  1 age and give  one age at a time?</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> well, it might be good to release information incrementally about the ageBrian Fioca: earlier in the cycle<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> give you all the information on that one age  in a more detailed form, pictures, maybe movies, a nice docunment.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> then just giving you a bunch of names?</div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> well, the problem is more complicated than thatIMForeman: I can just imaging if the DRC gave out early info that later turned out to be a wrong guess&#8230; then people like youself would accuse them of lying<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> IMF, that too,</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">John Lynch:</div> That makes sense. However if you already know the 50 names before you begin researching 1 age in depth, why not just release the 50 names? Sure a details form would be nice. But if you already know the 50 names, why not bother telling them as well? I imagine it wouldn&#8217;t take much effort if you already have the information.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> John, its more on what IMF had to say, wrong information. Name changes cause the D&#8217;ni wasn&#8217;t translated right.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">John Lynch:</div> Oh okay. So the information you haven&#8217;t released, your unsure as to  it&#8217;s reliability?Brian Fioca: who&#8217;s to say you&#8217;ve already hidden information by the time you release everythingBrian Fioca: *haven&#8217;t alredy i mean<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Brian, people will think what they wil. No matter what we do.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> nobody, but we wouldn&#8217;t know if they wereBrian Fioca: you understand that this civilization was more advanced than our ownBrian Fioca: there is a likelyhood that they have information that could give some people lots of powerBrian Fioca: and you could understand why they would want to keep it to them selves, could you not?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Brian what information do you really think we have?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> i&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to knowBrian Fioca: sigh<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> The DRC always needs to look over information before we release anything.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> for safety, rightJohn Lynch: Brian. Instead of assuming they&#8217;re guilty of something. Why not assume they&#8217;re innocent of something and look at the evidence from that standpoint?Brian Fioca: John, I&#8217;ll look at it from another perspective if you will<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Brian, there are so many unknowns down here.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> i understand MichaelBrian Fioca: believe me<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> Columbus thought he sailed to India, then called the native americans Indians, look how that has entered history books.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">John Lynch:</div> Good point. I would rather not have inaccuracies written in text books. Ancient Egyptian textbooks are annoying in that regard.IMForeman: It seems to me, Brian, that you are basing all this off Sharper&#8217;s ill-will&#8230; and Sharper aint the nicest guy in the worldIMForeman: In fact, he&#8217;s highly questionableBrian Fioca: Sharper&#8217;s not around&#8230; he&#8217;s going with phil i thinkJohn Lynch: What!? What makes you think that Brian?Brian Fioca: rumorsIMForeman: I doubt Phil would keep Sharper around.IMForeman: Phil seems concerned about things&#8230; Sharper&#8217;s a killer.Brian Fioca: killer??IMForeman: Not exactly a match made in HeavenBrian Fioca: listen, Phil told me that sharper was kind to himIMForeman: He killed one of the Teledahn CreaturesIMForeman: And sunk the bodyBrian Fioca: are you sure?IMForeman: Sold bits of it too.Brian Fioca: have you seen it?<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> So many rumors about Sharper.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">IMForeman:</div> It&#8217;s in his journal.Brian Fioca: ha&#8230; reading peoples journalsIMForeman: Plus he&#8217;s a Patriots fan&#8230; bah!Brian Fioca: Sharper&#8217;s an honest, hard working guyBrian Fioca: I respect his committment to helping fix up the place<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I don&#8217;t go read other people private stuff, and I have never even seen his journal.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">IMForeman:</div> I think he made it very easy to find, Michael.  He seemed to want it to be foundIMForeman: His journal makes very interesting reading.John Lynch: Yes there are Mr Engberg. But despite the unorthodox methods of gaining the information, there doesn&#8217;t seem much room for speculation....John Lynch: Mr Engberg, have you even seen his office?John Lynch: It has a very nice view of Kerath&#8217;s ArchBrian Fioca: I suppose you&#8217;re going to take him there, John?John Lynch: No need Brian. I&#8217;m sure he knows where it is and can get there himself.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> His office?</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">IMForeman:</div> The office overlooks the courtyard.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Michael Engberg:</div> I need to go, talk later.. interesting.. Office&#8230; hmm</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Brian Fioca:</div> Alright, we&#8217;re getting off topic hereIMForeman: Later, MichaelJohn Lynch: Bye Mr Engberg. And thanks.Brian Fioca: Remember the meeting about giving more informationBrian Fioca: make sure it happensBrian Fioca: Phil is in the nexus</div>
