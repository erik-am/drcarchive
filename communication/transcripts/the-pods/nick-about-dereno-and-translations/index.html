<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">DocOlanA:</div> We&#8217;ve got a group, the KTD, that meets Sunday nights. We&#8217;ve been trying to learn about the D&#8217;ni culture and religion of the Ri&#8217;neref era, but it&#8217;s difficult with the paucity of source material.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> Few days.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> Jazz give you that?</div>

<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">DocOlanA:</div> That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re interested in translations, even partial ones, of D&#8217;ni religious texts.(03/15 03:03:23) Jared: guess that&#8217;s a no on the Rehevkor<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> Wasn&#8217;t aware of that gropu.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">DocOlanA:</div> Yeah. It started three Sundays ago as a bit of a joke, and it turned out really interested.(03/15 03:03:35) sil_oh_wet: Great idea Doc(03/15 03:03:37) DocOlanA: Interesting, even.(03/15 03:04:04) DocOlanA: The problem is, we don&#8217;t know much about Ri&#8217;neref&#8217;s D&#8217;ni. Especially not about the Yahvo faith he keeps talking about. So we could use some translated texts to study.<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> Hmm&#8230; it was a while ago for lots of that stuff but I&#8217;ll freshen up. I was looking over it recently because Jazz wanted to know some stuff.</div></div>
<div class="transcript-no-highlight"><div class="transcript-name">Miranna:</div> Hellos everyone(03/15 03:04:46) DocOlanA: I figure it&#8217;s difficult to understand the D&#8217;ni without understanding their beliefs.(03/15 03:04:49) Sharaya: You sure know how to draw a crowd Nick. : )(03/15 03:05:00) Sumatria: indeed he does<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> One sec.

The sacred feminine is a recurring theme throughout many religions, though I&#8217;m not sure how many of the biological human functions taht caused women to be associated with oracles apply to the D&#8217;ni.(03/15 03:10:48) Curty: Speak for yourself;)<div class="transcript-highlight-1"><div class="transcript-name">Nick White:</div> Have you talked about taygahn?</div>
