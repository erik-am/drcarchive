<h2>Snippets from Nick</h2>


<p>Jazz gained some information about D&#8217;ni culture from Nick White and compiled them in the following imager posts for everyone&#8217;s reference.

MUSIC - Two famous D&#8217;ni singers. Hadev was one of of the great musicians. 5644-5894. Wrote D&#8217;ni folk stuff mostly. Seems as though one of the famous singers of his writings  was Suah, 5700-5993.</p>
<p>RELIGION - The D&#8217;ni valued taygahn. With Yahvo it was the most important thing. Better than doing good or evil it was a relationship. They thought the relationship with Yahvo would make sure they chose good over evil. That was the focus of their religion. Taygahn is a bit more than a relationship - not really a good translation for it.</p>

<p>FOOD AGES - There were two main kinds; livestock and crops. Both were run by the Guild of Caterers, although they worked closely with the Writers, obviously, in creating them.</p>

<p> Following on from Nick&#8217;s earlier snippets, he has answered some of the questions wich explorers raised.</p>
<p>1) The D&#8217;ni singer, Suah, was female.<br />
  2) Yahvo was considered a God, so the relationship would be similar to how we view a relationship with God.<br />
  3) The prophets claimed to speak directly to Yahvo at times, and other times through study.<br />
  4) In answer to the question of whether a translation of the Regeltavok of Oorpah will ever be available, he said, &#8220;Just pieces - will take time.&#8221; He did not specify when these pieces would be available.<br />

  5) Nick was not sure about the earliest references to otherworlders in D&#8217;ni. He thought maybe 2000.
