<h2>King Kedri</h2>

<p>This document was found in the Hall of Kings on Ae&#8217;gura.</p>

<div class="article">

<p>Kedri - Took the throne in 3654 at the age of 80.  Kedri, himself, was seen by many as a testament to the type of woman his mother had been. The day of Kedri&#8217;s coronation was the proudest moment of Shama&#8217;s life, she often said, up until the day she passed away in 3689. </p>

<p>Whether or not they agreed with Kedri&#8217;s decisions (it seems most did), there was seemingly hardly a single D&#8217;ni who did not greatly respect and care for Kedri. He was a king for the people and, most historians agree, was the most popular King of D&#8217;ni history, besides the Great King. </p>

<p>Kedri led a number of small proposals that often benefited the lower classes. At the same time, it seems, he assured the higher classes that the proposals were the right thing to do. </p>

<p>Up to that point, The Island had basically been set aside for the elite. It was Kedri who established the district of Shamathen (later changed to Kerath&#8217;en) as a &#8220;more affordable&#8221; residential district. </p>

<p>Kedri also donated his own Age of the Kings, written during the reign of his grandfather, to the Common Library. He directed money to massive renovation projects throughout D&#8217;ni, including further additions to the Great Temple, the Opera House, and further renovations to Belari, the deteriorating district that Rakeri had started years earlier. </p>

<p>In the numerous books and journals written about Kedri, it is said that he often walked the streets of D&#8217;ni and attended events with the rest of his people, as though he were one of them. </p>

<p>He was married in 3686 at a public ceremony that was open to all who wished to attend. As one writer said of the event, &#8220;if you did not want to be there, you did not want to be 
D&#8217;ni&#8230;&#8221;. </p>

<p>Kedri eventually passed away in 3903 at the age of 329, leaving the throne to his first-born son.</p>
