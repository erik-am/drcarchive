<h2>Stained Glass Windows</h2>

<p>The DRC invited the explorers to restore some stained glass windows. The best restored pieces were displayed in the neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>The DRC have recently located a few pieces of stained glass artwork depicting [Eder Tsogal / Eder Delin / the Great Zero] and are giving the explorers the opportunity to restore them to their former glory.</p>
