<strong>Title:</strong> Farewell<br>
<strong>From:&nbsp;</strong> Victor Laxman<br>
<strong>Date:&nbsp;</strong>  11/05/2007
</p>
<p>Good day all,</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this note to let you know that Marie and I have headed to the surface. I apologize that we could not make such an announcement in person but there were pressing reasons to get a start on what we deem as our next mission. You are well aware that Cate left the DRC for financial reasons. Judging the rumors, I&#8217;m not sure you are equally aware of Dr. Kodama&#8217;s reasons for leaving, but he has returned to the surface to try and find funding for this effort. He has not left the Council.</p>

<p>By now, I&#8217;m sure many of you have also heard of Yeesha&#8217;s visit. Upon hearing her words, we are more convinced than ever that we too must find a way. As a result, Marie and I have determined that the restoration will not continue without funding and we too, have taken it upon ourselves to search for such funding as well.</p>

<p>So, we leave you here to carry on the task that Yeesha has given us. We leave you here hoping that we will return soon with better news and a brighter hope for the future.</p>

<p>Watch yourselves and good luck.</p>

<p>Laxman</p>
