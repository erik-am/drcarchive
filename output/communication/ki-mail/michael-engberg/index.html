<strong>Title:</strong> DRC Member Michael Engberg Missing<br>
<strong>From:&nbsp;</strong> The DRC<br>
<strong>Date:&nbsp;</strong>  05/23/2007
</p>
<p>Explorers,</p>

<p>For those who have not yet heard, there was a collapse inside one of the buildings in the city on Sunday night at 8:40pm cavern time.</p>

<p>Two people were inside the building when the ceiling collapsed: Rosette “Rose” Taylor, who was killed in the initial collapse, and Willow “Wheely” Engberg, daughter of DRC member Michael Engberg, who was killed just before the rescuers arrived where she had been trapped.</p>

<p>Michael Engberg has since disappeared. He was last heard to mention the name of Dr. Watson, and then he was seen linking to the Rest House in the Great Shaft. These events occurred around 5:20pm Cavern time; his KI went offline sometime between then and 5:30pm. He has not been seen since.</p>

<p>If you have any information about the current whereabouts of Michael Engberg, please notify the DRC.</p>

<p>The DRC</p>
