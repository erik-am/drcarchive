<p>Simply put: Ahyoheek is a D&#8217;ni game very similar to rock, paper, scissors, although players are trying to collect three of an item (pen/beetle/page), instead of simply defeating their competitors and moving on.
The game can be played with from 2 to 5 players.</p>

<p>A round consists of one &#8220;throw-down&#8221;. Each player chooses whether they will play pen, page, or beetles. After all players have made their choices, the choices and winner are revealed. Each player&#8217;s selection is compared with each of the other players. 1 round-point is awarded for each victory (pen over beetles/beetles over page, etc&#8230;) and 1 round-point deducted for each loss.</p>

<p>The player with the most round-points in the round wins whatever he/she played. For example a player could play a pen and win with the round with two points. He/she is then awarded a pen and the next round begins. It is possible for multiple players to win each round. It is also possible for no player to win a round.</p>

<p>Example: one round in a five player game.</p>

<p>Player 1 chooses pen  <br/>
Player 2 chooses beetle  <br/>
Player 3 chooses beetle  <br/>
Player 4 chooses page  <br/>
Player 5 chooses page</p>

<p>This round is scored:  <br/>
Player 1 ends up with 0 pts. (-2 pts. against the beetles; +2 pts against the pages)  <br/>
Player 2 ends up with -1 pt. (-2 pts. against the pages; +1 pt. against the pen)  <br/>
Player 3 ends up with -1 pt. (-2 pts. against the pages; +1 pt. against the pen)  <br/>
Player 4 ends up with +1 pt. (-1 pt. against the pen; +2 pt. against the beetles)  <br/>
Player 5 ends up with +1 pt. (-1 pt. against the pen; +2 pt. against the beetles)</p>

<p>Players 4 and 5 each win a page toward their match goals.</p>

<p>A match consists of however many rounds are needed in order for one player to collect either three pens, three pages, or three beetles. In the event of a tie, the person with the most wins in the match (who has the greater total of pens, pages, and beetles) wins. If there is still a tie, the tied players participate in sudden death rounds until a winner is determined. When scoring systems are working properly, the winner of the match receives ranking-points based on the rank of the other players.</p>
